            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And ſo the Scriptures ſpeake, <hi>2 Ephe. laſt verſe, Yee are the habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi> And ſometimes they ſpeak in the language of the ſubordinate, <hi>3. Eph. 17. That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> Chriſt is in God, and God is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> John <hi>13.8. knoweſt thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me.</hi> And they that do not ſo know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they know <hi>Chriſt after the fleſh,</hi> as a <hi>branch</hi> of the firſt creation, and not as the <hi>root</hi> of <hi>both</hi> creations. And they that do not know themſelves <hi>thus,</hi> as dwelling in <hi>God</hi> and <hi>God</hi> in them, are ſtil under the <hi>Law;</hi> ſtick in the <hi>firſt Covenant,</hi> and know not the <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> but weakly. If yee ſee not the bleſſed face of <hi>Unity</hi> drawn throughout all <hi>diſtinction</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in <hi>Saints,</hi> yee ſee the <hi>Devill</hi> and an <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and are in the <hi>ſmoke</hi> of the <hi>bottomleſſe pit;</hi> though yet ye may be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>God.</hi> And therefore none may ſo ſecurely deſcend into the <hi>vally</hi> of diſtinction, as they that have been in the <hi>mount</hi> of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion: For they onely
<pb facs="tcp:106962:4"/>will, and can carry the <hi>Union</hi> along with them through all diſtinction, and that glory of the firſt <hi>Unity,</hi> that hath ſeated himſelf and dwels in their Eye, will bring forth himſelf in and upon all things, and in what various formes ſoever they preſent themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is the intereſt, the delight, the <hi>Food</hi> of Saints: Diſtinction, is the <hi>ſawce,</hi> or ſavour of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion. The Saints could not enjoy God, if He were not one with them: <hi>&amp;</hi> where were the delight, and wherein ſhould they be the richer by enjoying him, if he were not <hi>another</hi> from them? There could not be ſuch a raviſhing <hi>Concord</hi> and <hi>meeting</hi> between God and the Creature, without the <hi>parting</hi> and <hi>diſcord,</hi> firſt, of a created and un-created nature, and this <hi>diſcord</hi> and <hi>diſtance</hi> proceeding and let down through many ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (as between a <hi>Baſe</hi> and <hi>Treble</hi> in Muſick there are middle <hi>Notes</hi>) If we were not ſo <hi>low,</hi> and God ſo <hi>high,</hi> neither ſhould we be ſo tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this <hi>Match;</hi> nor would the <hi>condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of God be ſo manifeſted, and then where would be one of the greateſt glories of Gods love, and one of the quickeſt grounds of our joy? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot <hi>confound</hi> things, for ſo we ſhould offend againſt our own intereſt: and who doe this ſo much, as they that call themſelves Chriſtians,
<pb facs="tcp:106962:5"/>and yet make Chriſt in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and themſelves upon the <hi>Earth,</hi> confounding the things that God hath not only distinguiſt, but ſeperated; even the myſtery of <hi>Godlineſſe,</hi> which is <hi>God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the fleſh,</hi> And the myſtery of <hi>iniquity,</hi> which cals <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and denies the <hi>Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as we cannot confound things that God hath diſtinguiſt, ſo we cannot ſeperate the things that himſelf hath joyned: who hath joyned himſelf and Chriſt, and Chriſt and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S; the <hi>higheſt,</hi> with the <hi>loweſt;</hi> the <hi>firſt,</hi> with the <hi>laſt;</hi> the <hi>top,</hi> with the <hi>bottome;</hi> and therefore wee the <hi>loweſt,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not glory in leſſe or lower, then the higheſt of all. <hi>Wee joy in God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Rom. 5.) through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And God who is Lord, deſcends, and gathers up the very loweſt things, even our <hi>fleſh:</hi> makes <hi>the place of his feet glorious: wil loſe nothing:</hi> is preſent with the loweſt things as well as with the higheſt; though not after the ſame manner, or in the ſame manifeſtation, while they abide in their <hi>Iownes:</hi> but he will raiſe the loweſt to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and the loweſt ſhall be in the higheſt, and the <hi>higeſt</hi> in the <hi>loweſt:</hi> the whole creation in <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in <hi>God.</hi> The Rule therefore for things is this. To retain the
<pb facs="tcp:106962:5"/>diſtinction <hi>in the union, and the union in al diſtictions.</hi> And the Rule that God leads Saints by is this, to <hi>liſſen</hi> to God as he brings forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within them: to rejoyce in each <hi>degree</hi> of his light; waiting ſtill till be <hi>Faſhion</hi> every formleſſe lump into its right ſhape; and bring forth every imperfect Embryon to its full growth, and ſettle the <hi>Chaos</hi> into its diſtinction: not to <hi>out-run</hi> the appearances of God, and luſt or languiſh impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently after <hi>Meats,</hi> when God is eſtabliſhing our hearts with <hi>grace. I charge ye, O ye daughters of Jeruſalem that ye ſtir not up, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake my love</hi> (in his preſent deſingnment) <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he pleaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not to forget the <hi>end</hi> of this preface: It is in a word, to give a brief accompt of the drift of the enſuing Diſcourſes, and of the cauſe of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of them.</p>
            <p>As for the diſcourſes you will finde them preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the glory of <hi>Union,</hi> union with God and Chriſt, and Saints: This is the <hi>Mount</hi> into which this <hi>Diſcourſer</hi> hath been taken, and yet ye will finde the <hi>ſubordination</hi> and <hi>diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſo clearly acknowledged by him, as might have ſatisfied the obſerving and unprejudiced Reader though I had animadverted nothing upon it.</p>
            <p>To what I have ſaid concerning it, I ſhall adde
<pb facs="tcp:106962:6"/>onely this. That <hi>Diſtinction</hi> is the <hi>Wife,</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> the <hi>Husband.</hi> Distinction the <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion the <hi>ſtrength.</hi> Diſtinction the <hi>Law,</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Diſtinction the <hi>firſt Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion the <hi>ſecond Creation:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Distinction as the <hi>Woman,</hi> is barren and un-crown'd, unleſſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion <hi>reſt upon it:</hi> But if the ſupream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity will <hi>multiply</hi> and bring forth <hi>Himſelf</hi> in and upon <hi>each</hi> diſtinction, in and by <hi>Union,</hi> then indeed is diſtinction <hi>glorious.</hi> Diſtinction is as an Inſtrument of <hi>ten ſtrings,</hi> that in the hand of <hi>Union</hi> will make moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull <hi>Melody;</hi> otherwiſe it is but a <hi>jarring ſound.</hi> I am ſure, and have found out by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence theſe two things. That while a mans <hi>head</hi> is fraught with the <hi>riches</hi> of <hi>Diſtinction, leannes</hi> may enter into his <hi>ſoul.</hi> And that if we know a glory <hi>higher</hi> then that we are in <hi>union</hi> with, we cannot be <hi>happy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This for the diſcourſes. Now for publiſhing them. Ye are to put this <hi>Office</hi> wholly upon the accompt of the forward affections of ſome of the <hi>Hearers,</hi> who out of the <hi>beſt notes, compared together,</hi> have drawn forth this <hi>Copy,</hi> with a deſire to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part them for a more publicke benefit, which invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to prefix this word.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:106962:6"/>
            <p>If the Author, or rather he by whom theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes be miniſtred to us, doe pardon the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, ſo the Reader may receive good thereby, then there is all the reaſon, that ye for whoſe ſakes it is undertaken ſhould pardon the faults eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
            <p>For a farewell, Remember it is the finger of God onely that writes God in the <hi>heart.</hi> The wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>men</hi> are but a witneſſe of God in <hi>fleſh.</hi> Thus I leave it with you who am,</p>

            <p>[<hi>Let the Earth rejoyce, and the multitude of the Iſles be glad</hi>]</p>

            <p>Firſt, Here is the thing affirmed. <hi>The Lord reigneth</hi>]</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is the uſe of it, or the inference that is made from it. [<hi>Let the Earth rejoyce, and the multitude of Iſles be glad</hi>]</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Here is the means by which he aſcends into the <hi>Throne. [Clouds and darkneſs are round about him]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Here is a plain and certain Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition affirmed, [<hi>The Lord Reigneh</hi>] The Lord ſaith it, and the Lord is it. What ever the Lord ſaith, it is a <hi>Kingdome:</hi> what ever he is, he is a <hi>Kingdome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men have <hi>Reigned;</hi> and when men <hi>Reign,</hi> God <hi>Reigns</hi> to by men: and it was alwaies true, <hi>That all the Kingdomes of the Earth were
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:106962:13"/>the Lords and his Chriſts:</hi> and ſo all the <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> have been the <hi>Reign</hi> of God in <hi>figure:</hi> God hath <hi>Reigned</hi> in them, as in <hi>types;</hi> but that which we muſt <hi>now affirm,</hi> &amp; which the Lord affirms, is the <hi>immediate Reign</hi> of God: ſuch as that is which is expreſſed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. <hi>Thou who waſt, art, and art to come: haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to thee thy great power, and haſt Reigned.</hi> God did <hi>Reign</hi> inviſibly, while men <hi>Reigned.</hi> viſibly; or God <hi>Reigned,</hi> becauſe he gave <hi>Reign</hi> to others: but as there is his <hi>Reigne</hi> in <hi>giving,</hi> ſo there is his <hi>Reign</hi> in <hi>taking. Thou haſt taken to thee thy great power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord takes <hi>Reign,</hi> and <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> into himſelf: he takes off the <hi>Crown</hi> from the heads of <hi>Princes,</hi> and ſets it on his own head. It was adminſtred before by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; now God adminiſters <hi>power</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by himſelf. The other <hi>Reign</hi> was a <hi>leſſe,</hi> this the great <hi>Reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Haſt taken to thee thy great power.</q>
            <p>The greateſt <hi>Power</hi> that ever the Lord gave to men, is nothing, to that <hi>power</hi> which Chriſt will put forth, when he <hi>Reigns</hi> himſelf. And obſerve the <hi>companion</hi> of this <hi>power: When thou reigneſt, the Nations are angry.</hi> When God <hi>Reigns,</hi> the devill <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:</hi> when God comes to ſet up his <hi>power;</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106962:14"/>there is wrath and violence in the mindes of the men of the world: and when you ſee this <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>rage</hi> in the mindes of the men of the world, it is a ſure ſign, that God hath taken the <hi>Kingdome, Power</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>Here's two things of very ſweet conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Reign</hi> of the Lord: and</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Reign</hi> of the Lord in the <hi>Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, This <hi>Kingdome</hi> that God is now ſetting up, is his <hi>everlaſting Kingdome.</hi> It will not be adminiſtred by the weakneſſe of man, but by the <hi>power</hi> of God; not by the <hi>folly</hi> of man, but by the <hi>judgement</hi> of God. God will in this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> nakedly manifeſt his own righteouſneſſe, his own compaſſion and pitie; his own <hi>love,</hi> his own <hi>peace:</hi> Hee will doe all things <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> by his owne ſelf. And therefore all the pride and ambition, all the oppreſſion and tyranny, and miſcarriages that hath been in the government of men, ſhall be wholly taken away. Pure righteouſneſſe, and judgement, and equity ſhall be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly diſpenſed; and infinite <hi>power, ſtrength, holineſse, goodneſſe,</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> ſhall ſhine forth nakedly in the face of God: and that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106962:14"/>ſhall be, the <hi>Judge</hi> of all men.</p>
            <p>Wee ſhall no longer be abuſed and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, by the <hi>will</hi> of men, by the <hi>luſts</hi> of men. The poor people ſhall no longer groan, under the burden of mens <hi>luſts,</hi> nor ſweat for the pleaſure and contents of men; nor their <hi>faces</hi> any longer be ground, by the hardneſſe of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of men: but they ſhall be under the protection of God.</p>
            <p>The great cry now of the people, is, <hi>Let's have a King!</hi> Ye ſhall have one, one that will <hi>reign in righteouſneſſe;</hi> the LORD himſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And this <hi>Reign</hi> of the Lord ſhall be in his <hi>Saints;</hi> according to that in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. <hi>And the kingdome, and dominion, and the greatneſſe of the kingdome under the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt high, whoſe kingdome is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions ſhall ſerve &amp; obey him.</hi> As this kingdom ſhal be adminiſtred in the <hi>glory</hi> of God: ſo alſo in the ſweetneſſe and gentleneſſe of <hi>man,</hi> by brethren, by friends, by the Saints of the moſt High. God lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up himſelf in the Saints, will admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter this <hi>Reign;</hi> and as he will do it by the Saints, ſo he will doe it by the ſoftneſſe and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106962:15"/>tenderneſſe of the Saints, <hi>The kingdome and dominion under the whole earth, ſhall be given to the people of the Saints of the moſt High.</hi> It<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> now doing; that ye ſhall obey none but the Lord; ye ſhall know no other laws, but the Law of God; ye ſhall know no other Maſter but <hi>Jehovah.</hi> He hath made us <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> and we ſhall <hi>reign</hi> with him on earth. This nature of ours, this body of ours, ſhall <hi>reign</hi> with Chriſt, with God, and that upon earth.</p>
            <q>The Lord reignes</q>
            <p>The Lord hath ſerved, hath been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to much (yea moſtly) <hi>in the forme of a ſervant.</hi> It hath been, as it were, the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Lord, whilſt this world ſtood, to give ſupplies to men; to ſerve men; to give men ſtrength, and wiſdome, and rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and authority, and power, that men might be great and happy, with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God: and (in this) God hath been <hi>King</hi> too, but in an under way; As ſaith the Lord, <hi>I have ſerved with your ſinnes,</hi> and luſts: now he will no longer <hi>ſerve</hi> but <hi>Reigne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God will take all the <hi>Power</hi> and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity into his own hands. Hee will not be any longer under men: but above all men.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:106962:15"/>
            <p>Its time He ſhould be ſo: Its reaſon Hee ſhould be ſo: Its juſt He ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p>Every thing now muſt bowe, ſtoop &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, to the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>rule,</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of God. No man ſhall any longer ſay, it ſhall be ſo, becauſe it is my will to have it ſo: there ſhall not be found an heart, or tongue, that ſhall move againſt the Dominion of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Satan hath been a <hi>Prince;</hi> hee hath made Lawes of your captivity and miſery: Hee hath kept you to his <hi>task,</hi> to doe him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. He hath ſaid, <hi>Be angry;</hi> and then you have been full of <hi>rage.</hi> He hath ſaid, <hi>Be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous;</hi> and then you have been full of <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe.</hi> He hath ſaid, <hi>Bee Dark;</hi> and then you have beene full of <hi>blindneſſe.</hi> Hee hath ſaid, <hi>Be proud;</hi> and then yee have been full of <hi>haughtineſſe.</hi> And ſo he hath (but by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will) tormented the world.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſting</hi> of Satans whips are in your conſciences I know.

            <p>There is a continent of <hi>Earth,</hi> and there are <hi>Iſles</hi> that are naturally divided from the firme land, by water. They are in a lower, a weaker condition, then firme Land.

A little of the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God in Jeſus Chriſt, makes both Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106962:49"/>and Phariſees enquire after the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God: and you may obſerve how the Phariſees as wel as the Diſciples are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after heavenly things.</p>
            <p>Wee are troubled with the perverſeneſſe of the Phariſees, as well as the weakneſſe of the Diſciples; the Phariſee is moſt in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; they that are higheſt in their owne conceits, and moſt confident of their owne wiſdome, do moſt abound in propoſing que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, doe moſt deſire to grow in <hi>notions;</hi> Therefore tis not <hi>every one that asks ſhal have, nor every one that ſeeks ſhall find, but he that asks aright,</hi> We ſhal finde no queſtion, but we may ſee a <hi>Phariſee</hi> in it, though withall a <hi>Diſciple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The enquiry is after <hi>the kingdome of God.</hi> While it was preſent with them, they were in diſpute and queſtion concerning it; Chriſt telleth them, <hi>The kingdome of God is within you;</hi> it was in him, it was in them; Tis in me, tis in you, and yet yee enquire after it: therefore there is no <hi>queſtion</hi> but there's <hi>unbelief,</hi> there's <hi>darkneſſe:</hi> Take away unbelief, and darkneſſe, and emnity againſt <hi>the kingdome of God,</hi> and ye ſhall ſee nothing, but the <hi>kingdom of God:</hi> For there is nothing but <hi>the kingdome of God, that ſhines from Eaſt to Weſt;</hi> and while every man queſtions it, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106962:49"/>propoſes doubts, he ſhews in that what the kingdome of God makes him, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the evil &amp; puniſhment of his owne <hi>fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here is <hi>proud fleſh,</hi> wiſe <hi>Phariſees,</hi> asking after the higheſt glory, <hi>The kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While fleſh is up in queſtioning, the <hi>king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God</hi> is trampled upon: and yet ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is the <hi>fleſh,</hi> that when with <hi>cruel emnity</hi> they hate and perſecute, yet with <hi>ſeeming zeal</hi> they enquire after the <hi>Kingdom of God:</hi> and while the LORD ſaith—<hi>You are of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the devil</hi> (you are <hi>murderers</hi>) they ſay, We would fain ſee and enjoy the <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wretched man, while he is climbing high in his <hi>notions,</hi> in his <hi>underſtanding,</hi> to ſearch and prie into the greateſt myſtery of God (of God <hi>in his Kingdom</hi>) hee ſtands then at the greateſt diſtance from God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The kingdom of God</hi> is the <hi>ſubject</hi> of <hi>every mans diſcourſe,</hi> the <hi>object</hi> of every mans <hi>hatred:</hi> al <hi>men talk</hi> of it, and no <hi>man loves</hi> it; every <hi>man</hi> ſays, <hi>How, and when, &amp; where is it? how ſhall I know it? how may I ſee it,</hi> and no man can endure it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Kingdome of God</hi> is the deſtruction of the world (ſo the Diſciples knew) <hi>When ſhall thy comming, and the end of the world be?</hi> So long as the world is, <hi>The Kingdome</hi> is not. God reigns not, or there is a <hi>Kingdome</hi> of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:106962:50"/>God in the world, which is not <hi>THE KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOME,</hi> or, <hi>The Kingdom Come.</hi> This Kingdom as it manifeſts it ſelf, the world is not.</p>
            <p>And as every man <hi>dreads</hi> (every man cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Satan dreads) and hates the end of the world, and the deſtruction of all things: ſo every man hates the <hi>Kingdome of God.</hi> There is nothing ſo much flattered, nothing ſo much abuſed, as the <hi>Kingdome of God.</hi> Men would ſee it and know it (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot be ſaved without it) but are enemies to it, becauſe it comes with the deſtruction of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>There are many now further off from the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> then theſe Phariſees. If any thing of the Kingdome of God breake forth, they flie from it, they will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it. This is the Kingdome of God ſo far as it manifeſts it ſelfe—God <hi>reigning,</hi> God <hi>triumphing all in all:</hi> Where nothing is but God, nothing lives but God, none ſpeaks but God: Where God is upon the throne (of his own glory) where God lives alone, ſpeakes alone, ſaith, <hi>I am, and there is none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides me; When I have conquered and overcome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing to my ſelf, by the brightneſſe of my own glory, made every thing light like my ſelf, when all things ſpeak me, and acknowledge mee, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            </p>
            <p>And this man hates, this man dreads, this is death, death to all the world. This man cries out againſt as <hi>Blaſphemy:</hi> Man can be well contented that God ſhould be his <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> to bear him up, but not that God ſhould come uppermoſt, and ſay, <hi>I am the LORD:</hi> He can be content that God ſhould ſupport him in his weakneſſe, and give him <hi>the hopes</hi> of a Kingdome, but cannot bee content that hee ſhould bee a King.</p>
            <p>—<hi>When the Kingdome of GOD ſhould come</hi>]</p>
            <p>It comes, it muſt come. They were not ſo wicked (nor is there any Phariſee ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked) as to ſay, it ſhall never bee, but they would not have it as yet: They love to talk of it, more then to heare it, or ſee it: and are great pretenders to believing, but great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers to view and ſight. Phariſees are moſt certainely concluded in faith, to believe it ſhall bee, they care not for the ſight. The <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> is good at a diſtance, but hard and intollerable in preſence, becauſe it diſcovers and judges good and evil, it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106962:51"/>ſhewes men where they are, what they are. The wretchedeſt Jew in the world will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>ſacrifice</hi> in token of God to come, <hi>Chriſt to come;</hi> though when he comes they do op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, The ſame do men now.</p>

            </p>
            <p>By that reaſon, that judgement whereby you would comprehend and underſtand heavenly things; ye ſhall not.

            <p>None can obſerve this Kingdom, but the Kingdome it ſelfe; when yee come to it and enjoy it, yee ſhall ſee it: None can ſay this is the Kingdome, or that is the Kingdome, or this is not the Kingdome, or that is not the Kingdome, for it <hi>comes not with obſervation.</hi> It's not to be obſerved by the moſt ſtudious, the moſt inquiſitive, the moſt thirſting men after the knowledge of it; not by the beſt reaſon, the cleareſt judgement, the largeſt comprehenſion, the moſt curious ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:106962:51"/>of man: compare times with times, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with ſeaſons, Scriptures with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; all this is but <hi>obſervation,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this way, the <hi>Kingdome of</hi> God doth not <hi>come:</hi> to ſay, this is not the Kingdome of God, becauſe it doth not agree with this and with that, is to goe by <hi>obſervation;</hi> but <hi>The Kingdome of</hi> GOD, <hi>cometh not with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wretched man, ſilly ignorant man, blinde man, that dares ſubject this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God to his <hi>obſervation!</hi> But it comes not ſo. Men talk and babble, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue amongſt themſelves; <hi>we</hi> know this the Scripture ſaith, and this the Word ſaith, and therfore the Kingdome of GOD muſt be ſo, and ſo (this is <hi>obſervation</hi> and) by this the <hi>Phariſees</hi> rejected Chriſt; and by <hi>this</hi> a ſpiritual <hi>Phariſee,</hi> a more ſubtill <hi>Phariſee,</hi> the <hi>heire</hi> of the <hi>Phariſee</hi> doth daily, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually reject Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Away then with <hi>obſervation:</hi> The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is not ſo mean, and ſo baſe as to bee ſubject to humane capacity, to mens Reaſons—<hi>Chriſt was this, did this, wrought this;</hi> and therefore wee expect in the <hi>ſecond coming</hi> he ſhould <hi>do this, and work this,</hi> as he did then; this is the common vote of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106962:52"/>men, of reaſon;—If thou beeſt Chriſt, <hi>doe this,</hi> for God <hi>ſaith this,</hi> and Chriſt <hi>doth this:</hi> all this is <hi>obſervation.</hi> Chriſt a <hi>Servant</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) comes with <hi>obſervation;</hi> but Chriſt a LORD, <hi>comes not with obſervation:</hi> Chriſt in meanneſſe and lowneſſe, is ſubject to your reaſon; Chriſt in height and glory, is far above it.</p>
            <p>Chriſt doth the ſame in the Second ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, as he did in the firſt; but not with <hi>obſervation:</hi> not viſible and manifeſt in the <hi>fleſh;</hi> as thus, he <hi>raiſed the dead, opened the Eyes of the blinde, cured the lame;</hi> all this is done in his Second appearance; but in a higher, in a <hi>heavenly</hi> way, above and beyond <hi>obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt will not (you would have him, but he wil not) come againe in that Low Meane way, ſubject to <hi>Obſervation;</hi> and ſo, ſubject to the baſeneſſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>If any thing take notice of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf, its not Chriſt. He ſaith, <hi>That which men approve of, I will not owne; that which man commends, I abhorre.</hi>

            <q>—The Son of Man]</q>
            <p>This <hi>Holy Childe,</hi> is contented to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>man</hi> to bee his Father, or his Mother rather; to ſucceed <hi>man.</hi> But when Hee comes forth, Hee <hi>lives,</hi> and <hi>man</hi> gives place to Chriſt; and though in another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he is called the Son of <hi>man,</hi> yet Hee is the Son of GOD. (Hee is alſo called the Son of man, as hee is born of man, borne of the fleſh, <hi>taking our nature.</hi>) This is that

            </p>
            <p>Though ye are as that <hi>Woman</hi> in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> (in an excellent condition) <hi>Gloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Sunne, and the Moon under her feet,</hi> yet <hi>ſhee travelled to bring forth the Son.</hi> Though ye are never ſo glorious, and cloathed with brightneſſe and light, and are above the World, and above the Letter, and above Ordinances; yet <hi>ye</hi> muſt <hi>Travell to bring forth the Man-Childe.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>—Ye ſhall deſire to ſee one of the dayes of the Son of man, and ſhall not.</q>
            <p>When ye have conceiv'd him, and have felt the Babe ſtirring in you, <hi>Ye ſhall not</hi> be ſatisfied till ye have ſeen him brought forth. Ye ſhal have many deſires, &amp; ſhal not attain your deſires, many longings and loſe your longings; and ye ſhall cry and thirſt, and thirſt and cry ſo long, that ye can cry no longer; ye ſhall cry till the tongue cleaves to the roofe of your mouth; ye ſhall be parched with thirſt; ye ſhall be as <hi>Dives in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106962:62"/>hel,</hi> cry for a <hi>drop of water, one drop;</hi> ſo here in the Text, <hi>one day. Ye ſhall deſire to ſee one day of</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Many rejoyce in their deſires, and I know God in deſires is ſweet: but there are deſires that ſhall not be ſatisfied; there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and of ſeeing the Son of man. What will God deal ſo hardly with the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? ſo harſhly? Can the <hi>LORD</hi> hide himſelfe from his own fleſh? LORD, Canſt thou be ſo harſh as to deny thoſe that doe ſo much deſire to ſee thee? Yes, <hi>I can and will</hi> be ſo hard, and ſo cruell, as when they ſhall earneſtly deſire, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their deſires; though they be mine own deſires, begotten in them, yet to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie their deſires, I will burn them, I will deny them.</p>
            <p>Is there nothing in Chriſt but kindeneſſe and mercie? No! there is extream ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: If there be but a grain of fleſh come forth in your greateſt deſires, hee will nip all for that one, that there may be pure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to a pure Chriſt; If there be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand-fold heavenly Angels in your deſires; and but one carnall, fleſhly evil in them, he will deny all, till he hath killed that evil. He knows in the greateſt ſeveritie, how to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106962:63"/>fift every grain of duſt from the wheat, and to burn up all the droſſe from the gold. He is moſt cruell to fleſh, but moſt mercifull to ſpirit; and when he doth moſt reject de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, he doth moſt anſwer deſires: But you muſt not, nor ſhall not enjoy Chriſt ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily as you thought for. Such daies come as ye ſhall not ſee Chriſt; ye ſhall have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd deſires, and they ſhall be unſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and there ſhall be nothing but darknes within you, and without you, earneſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, thirſting deſires, and yet not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but all your deſires ſhall be throwne into the fire; and you with them.</p>
            <p>There is a boldneſſe and ſaucineſſe in the fleſh, grown up in a <hi>literal</hi> and <hi>fleſhly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> with Chriſt. Men come to have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acquaintance with Chriſt in the <hi>letter</hi> and fleſh, and then they think all evil is pall, all ſorrow is done away, and they thinke they have Chriſt at command, and they ſhall no ſooner <hi>ask then have;</hi> but that will not alwaies laſt: there will come that which will check this vanitie in the fleſh: Ye ſhall praie, and ſeek, and hunger, and thirſt, for one little glimpſe, one view of the Sonne of God, and ye ſhall not have it: If the Sonne of God were not as wiſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106962:63"/>as free to give, I could tell what men would doe, if God did not as well kill as make alive, men would be Judge, and not God: If hee knew not how to afflict and ſcourge, as well as reward, every one would abuſe him, and be Lord over him: If Chriſt had not a knife to cut off evil branches, all the juice and ſap of God would run waſte: If hee knew not how to lock up &amp; conceal himſelfe, as well as to open himſelf, he would be ſcatter'd, ſhed abroad and loſt.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But, ſaith the fleſh, this is not God, hee is not ſo ſharpe and fierce, hee is milde and gentle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> But if the <hi>LORD</hi> were not <hi>fire</hi> to you, to burn up evil diſpoſitions in you, he would not be <hi>water</hi> to refreſh you. And here is not all your evil neither; <hi>The Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſſe, and the Moon into bloud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe evil daies, the light and comfort of all your enjoyments, within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhall be darkned; and then they ſhall ſay to you, <hi>Loe here, and loe there;</hi> that's the time when your falſe Chriſts ſhall be ſeen. <hi>(Now)</hi> the Father is ſo mercifull to you, as not to let you <hi>(Yet)</hi> know what a <hi>falſe Chriſt</hi> is, what an <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is, but doth forbid Antichriſt to appeare: They
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106962:64"/>ſhall not ſay, <hi>Loe here, loe there,</hi> ye are not yet acquainted with ſuch a temptation as a <hi>falſe Chriſt</hi> is. But when the day of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſhall come, and when the deſires of ſeeing and enjoying the Sonne of God, then ſhall be the diſcovery of <hi>falſe Chriſts,</hi> and then ſhall ye be tempted with <hi>falſe Chriſts,</hi> Mat. 24.23. <hi>Then ſhall be great tribulation, ſuch as was not ſince the beginning of the world, to this time, no, nor ever ſhall be,</hi>—<hi>and except thoſe daies be ſhortened, there ſhould no fleſh be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: but for the Elects ſake thoſe daies ſhall be ſhortened,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto your deſires were never much drawne out after an immediate view and ſight of God: People look for that when they die: in the mean time, they will <hi>talk of God,</hi> they will <hi>hear Sermons,</hi> and goe to <hi>Church;</hi> yet there are ſome <hi>Diſciples,</hi> that ſecretly long after Chriſt, <hi>to ſee Chriſt;</hi> but falſe Chriſts never appear till we are gone <hi>beyond man,</hi> and above all the <hi>waies</hi> and <hi>daies</hi> of <hi>man:</hi> There are temptations ſutable to all conditions, and when ye are comming into the <hi>higheſt condition,</hi> ye ſhall have the <hi>higheſt temptation;</hi> when ye come farre from and above all men, and long to <hi>ſee Chriſt,</hi> then ye ſhall have <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſtirre and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:106962:64"/>While ye would be <hi>ſober men,</hi> ye are tempted to <hi>intemperance,</hi> While ye would be <hi>knowing men,</hi> ye are tempted to <hi>erre.</hi> While ye would be <hi>honeſt men,</hi> ye are tempted to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit:</hi> but when ye would live <hi>the life of Chriſt,</hi> then ye are tempted with <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and have <hi>falſe Chriſts</hi> preſenting themſelves to you. When ye come to <hi>thirſt</hi> after the day of the LORD, then will be the <hi>triall</hi> of theſe <hi>falſe Chriſts:</hi> Then ye ſhall have <hi>falſe Chriſts,</hi> preſenting themſelves unto you, ye ſhal have Chriſt <hi>come upon you</hi> more then <hi>you would have.</hi> If ye goe into the <hi>deſert,</hi> ther's Chriſt; if into the <hi>City,</hi> ther's Chriſt.

            <p>Such appearances wil preſent themſelves unto you, and invite you to the diſcovery and clear underſtanding of the dark places of Scriptures: but (ſaith GOD) <hi>folow them not.</hi> They are ſuch, <hi>that if it were poſſible,</hi> they <hi>ſhould deceive the very elect:</hi> ſo glorious and ſo beautiful, as for a while (ſo far as ye are men) ye ſhal be deceived.</p>

            <p>The Son himſelf ſaith—<hi>Goe not after them, for as the lightning ſhines from one part of heaven, unto the other &amp;c.</hi> Here is a greiveous condition; Evil daies, ſuch as <hi>never were before,</hi> nor <hi>ever ſhall be:</hi> earneſt deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, and yet no ſight of him; ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hunting after the <hi>true Chriſt,</hi> and beautiful and glorious <hi>falſe Chriſts</hi> coming and ſaying, <hi>I AM HE: This is he whom ye ſeeke.</hi> Hungry to death, and excellent meat (in appearance) offered, and no daring to meddle with it; thirſty and panting for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, and a river of pleaſures preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet not daring to venture on it. A ſad ſtate, much darkneſſe, great troubles, an earneſt ſeeking after deliverance, a voice from one that ſtands by, ſpeaking thus, <hi>here is one will ſave thee, and ſhew thee light;</hi> ſhal I follow him (ſaith the ſoul?) <hi>No ſaith Chriſt.</hi> Shal I lye in this darkneſſe and trouble and torment?

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:106962:66"/>lightneth from one part under heaven to the other, ſo ſhall the coming of the Son of man be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here's the reaſon why we muſt waite in theſe unheard of <hi>tribulations,</hi> becauſe Chriſt wil come on a ſuddain, <hi>as lightning;</hi> and then Hea will Shew US the truth of ALL.</p>
            <p>Chriſt wil immediately come, as quick as <hi>lightning;</hi> though he doth with-draw himſelf and deny our deſires, yet he wil come ſuddenly; and no <hi>fleſh</hi> (in its fleſhly condition) <hi>ſhall be ſaved; and except thoſe daies ſhould be ſhortened, no fleſh ſhould bee ſaved:</hi> it ſhal be intolenable for fleſh.</p>
            <p>This coming of Chriſt (or this day of Chriſt) it is beyond al the patience, and hope, and comfort, and ſtrength, of <hi>all fleſh:</hi> He wil come as quick as <hi>lightning;</hi> and though hee doth delay to come, at many diſires, yet now he wil come at the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; even then when ye are in the depth, <hi>under heaven;</hi> below <hi>heaven;</hi> under the <hi>earth,</hi> in the depths of the <hi>earth;</hi> even then the <hi>light</hi> of the brightnes of the <hi>Lord (Jeſus Chriſt)</hi> ſhines from one end under heaven to another: and ye ſhal ſee and know then, that ye are in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>When yee moſt deſire to ſee, and your
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106962:67"/>deſires are unſatisfied and perplexed for want of it; even then, The light of Jeſus Chriſt ſhines into the bottom of that yee are; in the darkeſt night of that Sunne ſet, (that Weſt:) even in the moſt unſatisfied condition that ye can pobſſile come unto, ſhal Jeſus Chriſt break forth, and ſhine in that dark pit.</p>
            <p>Goe not gaping after another, yee are in it already; The <hi>kingdome of heaven is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you.</hi> All this is but himſelf; His light ſhines from Eaſt to Weſt. He is as glorious in the Setting, as in the Riſing. Yee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any where out of him. He ſaith, <hi>When you think I am fartheſt off, then I will bee neareſt; when yee are hungry, I will give you bread; when ye are thirſty, I will give you water; when ye are in darkneſſe, I will be you light:</hi> and this only ſhal be your reſt and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: <hi>the Lord is ſalvation, where ever he is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saith Antichriſt, <hi>I'le give you a cleare diſcovery of all things; I'le give you peace: No</hi> ſaith the <hi>Elect,</hi> I am already with Chriſt, I am nothing but what He is, Hee is nothing but what I am; I am with Him, and in Him; He is with me and in me: why ſhould I goe out after another? <hi>For as the lightning &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:106962:67"/>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt is the loweſt ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which you can be; and he comes quick as <hi>lightning,</hi> and then as lightning, wil give you, and is giving you, the ful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of all things. When he is in you at the depth, the loweſt point, the centre of <hi>hell,</hi> the bottom of the grave, it is that hee might give you a <hi>full Reſtoration</hi> of all things.</p>
            <p>The <hi>lightning from eaſt to weſt,</hi> makes <hi>eaſt</hi> and <hi>weſt</hi> meet together: ſo this appearing of the Son of God, darkens, fleſh, confounds man, and makes the <hi>higheſt</hi> glory of God to be in the <hi>loweſt</hi> pit; and takes the <hi>loweſt ſtate</hi> of darkneſſe, into the <hi>higheſt</hi> pich of light.</p>
            <p>By theſe flaſhes, <hi>fleſh</hi> ſhal be blaſted, and deſtroied, and conſumed. Theſe blaſts of the Spirit of the Lord doth open US, and enlarge US to a large comprehenſion of all things; of all in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> of all in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> of all above, and all below: Til wee be low, we can't be high; til we be the <hi>worſt,</hi> we cannot be the <hi>beſt;</hi> and we are <hi>beſt,</hi> when <hi>we</hi> are <hi>worſt;</hi> in the greateſt darkneſſe, He is preſent; in the bottom and heart of ſuch tribulations, that all before it is nothing to <hi>it,</hi> and nothing is like it, that comes after it.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:106962:68"/>
            <p>In this tribulation, not to ſee and know <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> in this tribulation to have longing deſires, and then to have peace and deliverance <hi>ſeemingly</hi> tendered to us by a <hi>tempter;</hi> we cannot but obhor it: to have joy and gladneſſe ſounded in our eares, and not be able to touch it; What an extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is here? The abſence of the <hi>higheſt</hi> good, the preſence of the <hi>greateſt</hi> evill; our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires not anſwered by God, and anſwered by Satan.</p>
            <p>Out of this darkneſſe, wil Chriſt ariſe; out of the extreamity of <hi>deaths</hi> and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, doth the Son nf God ariſe: it is as neſeſary ye ſhould bee brought into this <hi>ſtate,</hi> as it is that the Night ſhould go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Day.</p>
            <q>—But first muſt hee ſuffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.</q>
            <p>The Deſciples of God, ſhal not injoy Chriſt, til they have rejected him.

            <p>God ſends forth Chriſt; Chriſt is of <hi>God;</hi> Man is of Chriſt. <hi>The woman is of the man.</hi>

            <p>The firſt is above the ſecond; and is that which cauſes and gives being to the effect, therefore greater then the effect. Chriſt deſcends from God; is of him. Man is of Chriſt: Woman is of the Man.</p>

            <p>But this is moſt common and evident, and People are beſt acquainted with it. God deſcending down to Chriſt; Chriſt aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to GOD.

            </p>
            <q>For this cauſe hath a woman power on her head—</q>
            <p>
               <hi>GOD</hi> hath given a power to Chriſt, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf. And <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath given a power to <hi>Man</hi> over himſelf. As <hi>man</hi> doth give a power to the <hi>woman</hi> over <hi>himſelf.</hi> Though GOD be the original of his own power, yet he is pleaſed to give it to his <hi>Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It pleaſeth God ſo to exalt Chriſt that he ſets him on his <hi>right hand.</hi> It plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Chriſt to exalt Man and doe as much for him; ſet him at his <hi>right hand.</hi> And ſo it pleaſeth Man to <hi>honour Woman,</hi> and ſet her at his <hi>right hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Love</hi> of the Father is ſo great to his <hi>Sonne,</hi> that as he is for his nature equal with him; ſo for his <hi>love</hi> he ſets him

            <p>Chriſt is ſo delighted in Man, that hee gives him that honour, as to ſet <hi>him</hi> at His <hi>Right band.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God hath not the leſſe Honour becauſe he gives it to Chriſt, or to Man. The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hath the greater glory, when he gives it to the <hi>woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The love of God hath this deſigne upon Chriſt, and through Chriſt upon us; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath this deſigne upon us, which the Man hath over the Woman; to give us <hi>Power</hi> over Himſelf.</p>
            <p>Though all <hi>Power</hi> be in the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God,</hi> yet he is pleaſed to give <hi>us Power</hi> over Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And this is the reaſon, <hi>Becauſe of the Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queſtion is Stated, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the two former Verſes, <hi>For this Cauſe ought the woman to have power on her head.</hi>

            <p>Ther's not a full harmony betwen God and Chriſt, and Chriſt and us, til by the <hi>grace</hi> that hee gives us, <hi>we</hi> have power over him; or the Father hath not done all that he hath to do, til he hath ſet his <hi>Son</hi> at his <hi>Right hand.</hi> The <hi>Son</hi> hath not done all that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:106962:92"/>he ought to doe, til hee hath ſet us at his <hi>Right hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Father oweth to <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Kingdome,</hi> the <hi>Throne;</hi> and hee doth not right til hee gives it him: and ſaith, <hi>Son take the Throne, It's thine:</hi> I have exerciſed <hi>dominion and power</hi> hitherto; Now <hi>do thou take it, do thou reigne.</hi> And Chriſt hath not done all that he hath to do, til he hath ſet <hi>us</hi> down in his <hi>Throne,</hi> as he is ſet down in <hi>his Fathers Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And (ſaith Chriſt) though the Father be <hi>greater then I,</hi> yet through the love of the Father, I have power to ſay to the Father, <hi>Father, I will;</hi> and <hi>I wil have it ſo and ſo.</hi> and though we are creatures below <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet we have the ſame priviledge to ſay, <hi>I will;</hi> and <hi>I will have it ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if GOD exerciſeth his Dominion without this <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>volentary</hi> ſubmiſſion, he doth not all the worke of a <hi>Lord,</hi> of a <hi>Husband.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Except <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth <hi>deſcend</hi> from his <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> in ſome meaſure; I ſay from <hi>His great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and come down a little from <hi>ſtrict termes</hi> of his Highneſſe, he doth not what he ſhould do.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:106962:93"/>—For this cauſe ought the woman to have power over her <hi>Husband</hi>]</q>
            <p>It's the duty that the Superiour owes to the Inferiour, to love, to give honour and reſpect.</p>
            <p>GOD hath written out <hi>this</hi> exceeding plain and clear; as he ſaith to <hi>Moſes, Let me alone.</hi> The loving opertunity of Moſes was exceeding pleaſing to <hi>God,</hi> and held him by a kinde of violence; a power and ſtrength under which <hi>GOD</hi> ſuffered, <hi>Let mee alone. Jacob</hi> was admitted to the ſame priviledge, <hi>Let me goe,</hi> ſaith <hi>God;</hi> no, ſaith he, <hi>I will not let thee goe:</hi> he had that power to <hi>chain</hi> God to his pleaſure, <hi>No, thou ſhalt bleſſe me; I will not let thee goe.</hi> Yet this wil in us, is the wil of our <hi>husband</hi> and <hi>head;</hi> and it pleaſeth <hi>him</hi> to put this wil into us, that it might <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which a Husband loves, and is agreeable to his nature, that he loves ſhould come from his <hi>wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though a thing ſeeme never ſo good and pleaſant to God, yet it delights him to have it come from our requeſts: Nay, our requeſts do not pleaſe Him, ſo much as
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106962:93"/>our violence: It pleaſeth him to be <hi>held</hi> by violence by <hi>that</hi> love which hee gives; Hee <hi>was held in the galleries.</hi> He is contented to have his own will to bee ſubjected to the will of thoſe that he delights in.</p>
            <p>And in plain termes, He hath given out this priviledge—<hi>Concerning the works of my hands, Command ye Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A loving Husband gives all the power that hee hath over his Family, unto his <hi>wife;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>They are at thy command,</hi> all in <hi>thy</hi> power; though they are mine, yet I free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtow them upon <hi>thee.</hi>—<hi>And concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the works of my hands, Command ye me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greatneſſe of God never manifeſts it ſelf more, then in coming down and being a Servant; or, his power appeares moſt in Subjection.</p>
            <p>If power can only Reign, and not Serve, it is not Excellent power: but when power exerciſeth it ſelf, Now in a Command, and then again ſends forth it ſelf into obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Subjection, ther's the Excellency of it.</p>
            <p>To give <hi>Lawes,</hi> and only to give <hi>Lawes,</hi> were to be a Tyrant; and to make <hi>Lawes</hi> to keep us under, were Slavery: But to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>us</hi> to give <hi>Lawes</hi> to Him; and rule <hi>us</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:106962:94"/>ſo, as we may rule Him, to communicate to <hi>us</hi> ſo, as that Hee <hi>himſelfe</hi> can take the place of a Servant, This is Excellent <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Lord-ſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>LORD</hi> hath exerciſed the part of a KING over us, towards us, he delights then to deſcend from his <hi>Throne,</hi> and to ſee <hi>us</hi> (as KINGS) act our part, our <hi>power</hi> over Him.</p>
            <q>—For This Cauſe ought the woman to have Power over her head]</q>
            <p>
               <hi>For this cauſe,</hi> That there may be a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and an Agreement between <hi>them. For this cauſe,</hi> That the Womans yoke may bee eaſie, delightfull and pleaſant. <hi>For this cauſe,</hi> That there may be no diſcontent: <hi>for this cauſe,</hi> That there may be <hi>perfect love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There could not be ſuch a Harmony, if the <hi>LORD</hi> ſhould alwaies ſhut up himſelfe in Power, and wee alwayes Serve him in Strictnes of Authority, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee alwaies hold forth himſelf unto us, in Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, doe <hi>this,</hi> and doe <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>the other;</hi> What delight could He have in <hi>us,</hi> or <hi>we</hi> in Him? If it were nothing but thus, wee ſhould alwaies ſtand at a diſtance, or run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106962:94"/>way from him in fear. Would he? No he could not take content in us, becauſe wee ſhould be to weake and low for him; if he did not give us Power, we were not <hi>ſutable</hi> for him: And if the LORD did not open himſelf <hi>to us,</hi> and ſhew us <hi>our power</hi> over His <hi>heart,</hi> as wel as His Power over <hi>us,</hi> we could not <hi>ſo</hi> approach to him as <hi>we doe;</hi> we could not <hi>ſo</hi> take pleaſure in him.</p>
            <p>And we know this, That it pleaſeth the LORD our GOD, that our <hi>fellowſhip with him,</hi> ſhould bee delightfull and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory <hi>to us.</hi> If <hi>we</hi> were <hi>below</hi> Him, <hi>below</hi> the <hi>greatnes</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> if he did not <hi>greaten us,</hi> and <hi>heighten us, we</hi> were not fit for his Society.</p>
            <p>If he did not give ſuch priviledges to us as <hi>theſe, we</hi> might ſay to <hi>him,</hi> as the Woman did to <hi>David, ſhall I waſh the feet of the ſervants of my LORD.</hi> If God did not cloath us with his owne garments, his owne Power and glory, put upon us his own Majeſtie, his own <hi>ſelf;</hi> if it were not his <hi>owne greatneſſe</hi> with which we come unto him; if he did not make us <hi>fit,</hi> with that which hee makes for himſelf, <hi>we</hi> ſhould not be <hi>fit ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> for him. Hee <hi>owes</hi> this to Chriſt upon this ground, that Chriſt is equal with <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> And <hi>Chriſt owes</hi> this to Man upon this
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106962:95"/>ground that man is equall with <hi>himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a certain equallity between the Father and the Son — <hi>He thought it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equall with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we are exceeding bold (in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God) to ſay, it's no <hi>robbery, in ſome ſence, that we are equall too:</hi> Therefore Chriſt is entered into a low eſtate with us, that <hi>he</hi> might be one with us in a low eſtate. And we are raiſed to a high eſtate, to be one with him in power and great <hi>glory;</hi> that it may be counted no robbery to be <hi>epuall</hi> with <hi>him; To ſit down with him in heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> to be as he is; to be where he is; to ſit at his table; to eat as he eates; drink as he drinks; drink and be <hi>merry.</hi> But this is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily confeſt, the <hi>equallity</hi> between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son.</p>
            <p>If the Father gives not power to him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf there were no equallity.</p>
            <p>If I did not give that power that I have to command thee, unto thee, that thou ſhouldeſt by this power command me by way of love; and as I have ruled thee as a <hi>Father,</hi> thou ſhouldeſt rule me as a <hi>Son:</hi> And as I have ruled thee as a <hi>Head:</hi> If I were not contented now to lay down my <hi>bead-ſhip,</hi> that thou <hi>may'ſt</hi> as a <hi>wife</hi> over-rule me with
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:106962:95"/>thy <hi>Love;</hi> there were no equallity.</p>
            <p>But there is a leſſer reaſon, yet a great one; <hi>Becauſe of the Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This power of the <hi>Wife</hi> over the <hi>Husband</hi> is but what he gives, and what he lowes.</p>
            <p>Yet there is a reaſon for it, and that is the <hi>Angels.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> are friends to this truth: or this is the <hi>Angels</hi> priviledge.</p>
            <p>When the great God brought forth his <hi>Son: (Mark)</hi> as he did in this lower creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo he did in the <hi>Heavenly</hi> creation; he brought forth <hi>male and female,</hi> in that <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> creation he brought forth the <hi>firſt borne,</hi> he brought forth <hi>male and female;</hi> or he bouught forth <hi>head and members:</hi> Chriſt and <hi>Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that which I ſhall ſay is this: In this ſtate doth all the Sons of God ſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; heer was that the Son took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in; in the habitable parts of his Earth Chriſt was brought forth: and <hi>Angels</hi> are as it were his body, or his <hi>Spouſe.</hi> Now in this ſtate and condition the Angels and Chriſt they ſung together, or the Sons of God ſung together; as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>There is no note that Chriſt the head of <hi>Angels</hi> ſung, but they ſung too: there is no praiſe that Chriſt gave to God, but
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106962:96"/>the Angels that have fellowſhip with him, gave to God the the ſame. There's no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that Chriſt received from his Father: but they receiv'd the ſame in their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by vertue of that, they had that which we ſpeak of; <hi>power over Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh, there was ſuch an <hi>intimate, dear</hi> and <hi>ſweet</hi> fellowſhip between Chriſt and them, that they had <hi>power</hi> over him, as he had <hi>power</hi> over them.</p>
            <p>Now when the <hi>LORD</hi> makes an Image of this <hi>heavenly</hi> creation, in this lower World; and brings forth that world into this World; he makes heer as he did there; <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>woman; therfore doth the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that the woman</hi> ſhould have that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over <hi>her head,</hi> that <hi>her antitype</hi> Angell had. Or Angels will ſecure and make this good: the excellent Angels will make this good: <hi>That the Womon ſhould have power over her head,</hi> becauſe it is their <hi>priviledge,</hi> to have power over Chriſt their <hi>head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the devil would debar the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from it, yet the Angels, good Angels, do defend it; they ſecure it, it's their place, their priveledge. So that Chriſt who is the great Angel, the Angel of preſence; it is his priviledge to have power over his head.</p>
            <pb n="169" facs="tcp:106962:96"/>
            <p>He is an <hi>Angel,</hi> a <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> ſent out from God: yet can ſay, <hi>I am ſuch an Angel, ſuch a Meſſenger ſent out from God, that I have ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, ſuch favour to have power over him. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> come forth from him; may ſay, Thou haſt ſent us forth from thee, thy <hi>Meſſengers;</hi> yet <hi>we</hi> have this priviledge, to have <hi>power</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee. And man may ſay freely to, <hi>Lord</hi> thou haſt ſent me forth, thy ſervant: I am thy <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> thy <hi>Angel,</hi> and though ſent out from thee, yet ſtill I have <hi>power</hi> over thee.</p>
            <p>The Father ſends out the <hi>Angel,</hi> Chriſt to doe his <hi>will;</hi> yet is ſtil contented to take wiſdome and councel of Chriſt, and to be inſtructed by him:—<hi>Thy right hand ſhall teach thee terrible things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt comes out as a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> from God concerning men. God takes councell of Chriſt of the things of man.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſends out <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> is his <hi>Meſſenger;</hi> yet is willing to take inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from him, in managing the affaires of the World.</p>
            <p>To confirme this truth. <hi>That there is a kinde of honour, true honour, that the woman hath given her by the man over the man. So Chriſt over God: And we over Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="170" facs="tcp:106962:97"/>
            <p>Yea, the ſame thing affirmed, and the reaſon of it, in the laſt chapter of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> at the tenth <hi>verſe</hi> and ſo on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Who can finde a vertuous woman, for her price is far above rubies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The heart of her Husband doth ſafely truſt in her, ſo that he ſhall have no need of ſpoil; ſhe will doe him good and not evil all the gaies of her life: She ſeeketh wool and flax, and worketh dilligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with her hands. She is like the Merchants ſhips, ſhe bringeth her food from afarre. She conſidereth a field and buieth it with the fuit of her hands. She planeth a vinyard</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We know the <hi>figure;</hi> how <hi>woman</hi> is to Man ſhe is made a meet healp to him. How ſoletary and alone is Man without the <hi>wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> how deſolate, wanting that ſociety; how unable he is to multiply himſelf; to perpetuate a generation to himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her. How looſe, ayrie, and wandering a thing is he, till he fixeth and faſteneth by <hi>marriage.</hi> Such benefit hath God by Chriſt: ſuch benefit hath Chriſt by us. Such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath the Father to exalt the Son. Such reaſon hath our Lord to exalt us.</p>
            <p>— <hi>Her price is far above Rubies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Woman is the glory of the Man:</hi> The Church is the riches of Chriſt. We are the glory of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:106962:97"/>Chriſt. Chriſt the glory of God.</p>
            <p>A man ſhines not gloriouſly, but in his wife. Chriſt ſhines not gloriouſly but in his Church. God ſhines not gloriouſly, but in his Son.</p>
            <p>God is <hi>poor</hi> without Chriſt; <hi>mean,</hi> hath no <hi>riches</hi> if he have not his Son.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is a <hi>poor</hi> head, if he hath not his Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> is alone, ſolitary, wanting ſociety, till he entertaines his Sonne into <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with himſelf.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is alone and ſolitary, till he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains the Church into fellowſhip with himſelf.</p>
            <p>GOD certainly gives all his power to do his Son good.</p>
            <p>I know that my glory thou art. I have it not except you have it. I can freely and ſufely commit it to you, for you are my ſelf.</p>
            <p>So ſaith Chriſt. I have no glory except you have it. Yea, I have it in the ſweeteſt way when I have it in you. (I mean a chaſt Church; a chaſt Spouſe, married to Chriſt) Chriſt can as certainly commit his power to her, as to himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The heart of her husband doth ſafely trust in her.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="172" facs="tcp:106962:98"/>
            <p>As we are ſafe no where but in <hi>GOD,</hi> ſo GOD is ſafe no where but in US; as GOD is our keeper, ſo we are his. And this <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> would be loſt (the <hi>treaſure</hi> of God) if not found in Chriſt. The <hi>treaſure</hi> of Chriſt would be loſt, if not found in the Church: The Heavenly liquor, or <hi>wine</hi> of Heaven, <hi>GOD,</hi> would be loſt, if there were not this <hi>veſſel,</hi> Chriſt, to put it in.</p>
            <p>And this Heavenly liquor, or <hi>wine, Chriſt,</hi> were loſt, if there were not <hi>you</hi> to but it in.</p>
            <p>God needs ſuch a <hi>veſſel</hi> as <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to put himſelf in; Chriſt needs ſuch a <hi>veſſel</hi> as <hi>you,</hi> to put himſelf in.</p>
            <p>GOD would runne every way, ſettle no where, be bounded in nothing, if he did not ſettle in his Son. The Son would reſt no where, have no content, if it were not in <hi>thee.</hi> Men would run every way, reſt no where, if not bounded by a <hi>wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is not well, or ſafe, til he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>you, in you</hi>—<hi>The Goſpell is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Glory of the <hi>God-head</hi> is committed to Chriſt, and there tis ſafe: Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to <hi>you,</hi> and there is ſafe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The God of all excellency and treaſure, is moſt ſafe, when he is committed to us.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>So that he ſhall have no deed of ſpoil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being made <hi>vertuous</hi> by the Spirit of our God (for therein we are made <hi>vertuous</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>one Spirit,</hi> He ſhall have no need of <hi>ſpoile:</hi> God hath no need to uſe the <hi>Septer</hi> and <hi>Sword,</hi> to <hi>arme</hi> himſelf againſt us, but in love and kindneſſe; there need's no <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> of us: When we are ſubdued into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—<hi>Ther's no need of ſpoil.</hi> This aſſurance that he hath of us, by giving Himſelf unto us, is the <hi>quiet</hi> that Hee hath in us.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>All her houſhold are cloathed with ſcarlet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fruit of the Womans labor, is the Husbands cloathing.</p>
            <p>The LORD our GOD is Cloathed, God and all the People of God, are <hi>cloathed</hi> by Chriſt: And Chriſt and all his Family, are <hi>cloathed</hi> by the Church. Let the Church have this Felowſhip, None ſhall goe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed, every thing amongſt us ſhall bee
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:106962:99"/>full of the Spirit of our God; all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of God now, is Cloathed in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>She is like the Marchants ſhips, ſhe bringeth her food from farre: ſhe conſidereth a field, and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; with the fruit of her hands, ſhe planteth a vinyard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Chriſt hath this fulneſſe of the Father, He puts forth and plants a Church, and <hi>eats the fruit.</hi> When wee have this full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>we</hi> plant and eate too. Chriſt comes down to us, as into a <hi>far country,</hi> to carry us to God. Chriſt comes <hi>down to us;</hi> we come <hi>down into the world,</hi> to trade, traffick and deal for God.</p>
            <p>So in all this, the favour that God gives to us, is to give US a Propriety with Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, over Himſelf.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, Neither is the Man without the Woman, nor the Woman without the Man in the LORD.</p>

            </q>
            <p>Theſe two are unſeperable, Man and Woman: In the LORD, they are unparta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It's Sin and Satan, <hi>the accuſer (of the

            <q>—The Man is not without the Woman, nor the Woman without the Man]</q>
            <p>Yee never ſee God, but with Chriſt in his boſome; you never hear of a God, but you hear of a Chriſt too. GOD will never ſpeak, or act any thing but with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And yee never ſee Chriſt without his Church. Ye never ſee the Son of God, but ye ſee the Spouſe in his boſome.</p>
            <p>If ever Chriſt be torne ffo from God, it is by violence of Death, of Satan, and of Sin.</p>
            <p>If ever wee bee rent from the <hi>boſome</hi> of Chriſt, its by the Devil, Death and Sin. Yet then when wee are rent from him, are we with him.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt was in the <hi>loweſt eſtate, in hel,</hi> hee was in <hi>Heaven alſo; Noe one is deſcended from Heaven, but he which is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ye never finde God without Chriſt, nor Chriſt without the Church, nor Man without Woman.</p>
            <p>Yee never finde the Church without Chriſt, nor Chriſt without God, nor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without the Man.</p>
            <pb n="177" facs="tcp:106962:100"/>
            <p>If ye finde a Church without Chriſt, tis a <hi>Harlot;</hi> if you finde a Chriſt without a God, 'tis an <hi>Antichriſt.</hi> The true Church is alwayes as the Woman, never without the Man; you never finde her but in baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſin without the Man: you never finde Ciriſt without God, nor the Woman <hi>without the Man, in the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>— In the LORD.</q>
            <p>If theſe <hi>two</hi> are partable, it's not in the LORD, it's without the <hi>LORD;</hi> but if they are reconciled <hi>in the LORD,</hi> they are never parted—<hi>Neither is the Man without the Woman, Neither is the Woman without the Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore give us leave to diſclaim a <hi>God</hi> without a Chriſt; or a Chriſt without a People. Ye do not ſee God, except ye ſee Chriſt; ye ſee not Chriſt, but ye ſee GOD alſo; yee ſee not Chriſt, but you ſee your ſelfe.</p>
            <p>It is not <hi>true</hi> Chriſt, <hi>only</hi> Chriſt, <hi>THE</hi> Chriſt, except thou ſeeſt him in thy owne perſon; except thou ſeeſt thy ſelf with him. If thou ſeeſt <hi>him</hi> one, and <hi>thy ſelf</hi> another, its a <hi>Sad ſight,</hi> an <hi>Ill ſight,</hi> its no true fight: you
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106962:101"/>cannot ſee the Son, but you muſt ſee your ſelf with him: ſee him in the higheſt glory that you can, you ſee him not <hi>right,</hi> except you ſee your ſelf there—<hi>Man is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you would give God an exaltation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove your ſelf, hee will not. God ſaith, I will not be exalted except my <hi>Son</hi> be there: <hi>God will not exalt his</hi> Son <hi>where you are not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Son ſaith, I will not be where you are not; I cannot be where you are not, I cannot bee <hi>without you</hi>—<hi>The Man is not without the Woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>—Neither the Woman without the Man]</q>

            <p>Chriſt cannot be any where but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is with him, <hi>I am not alone, the Father is with me:</hi> when he was in the loweſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that could bee, when God ſeemed to leave him, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:106962:101"/>too: when Chriſt ſuffered and dyed, God ſuffered and dyed; it was <hi>the bloud of GOD: If I go down to hel, thou art there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when thou knoweſt thy ſelfe to bee <hi>the wife</hi> and <hi>ſpouſe</hi> of Chriſt, then thou canſt ſay, I am in hel indeed, but my Lord <hi>is with me;</hi> I am in hel, in death and ſorrow, but Chriſt <hi>is with mee</hi>—<hi>The Woman is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the violence of Satan cannot take the Son from the Father; If he doth take him any whither, the Father will go with him: yea, though the Son doth go away, the Father goes along with him into that <hi>humiliation.</hi> Neither can any thing rend us from <hi>the boſome of the Father;</hi> but if we be, or hereafter may bee by temptation rended from him, yet wee ſhall ſee our Lord in temptation: Where the one is, the other is: where one is, both are.</p>
            <q>—The Man is not without the Woman]</q>
            <p>He ſaith, I have no glory, but what thou haſt; wee ſay, wee have no weakneſſe, but what thou haſt. Thus doth the <hi>LORD</hi> our <hi>GOD</hi> enterchange with us; He makes US High and great with Him: and makes
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106962:102"/>Himſelf Low and Nean with US.</p>
            <p>And this is another reaſon that ſecures that power which is given to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And though ſhe rule over me; yet I rule, becauſe ſhe is my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though I give her my power, I give her my will too: Fo 'tis what I pleaſe. And (ſaith Chriſt) though I give it you, yet tis mine; and there is nothing in you but my will; yea, for my good.</p>
            <p>And as I give you my will, ſo I give you my power; and you cannot abuſe me, be cauſe you are my ſelf. (No one hateth his own <hi>fleſh</hi> but loves and cheriſheth it) And when you exerciſe this power over me, it is my ſelf.</p>
            <q>—The Woman is not without the Man]</q>
            <p>In communion, you are now the Man, and I the Woman; as I was the man, and you the woman: as I was mighty in you; and you weak in me: as I was weak in you, and you mighty in me.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Husband</hi> ſhould reſerve any thing from the <hi>Wife;</hi> then the <hi>Husband</hi> would be without the <hi>Wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If God ſhould reſerve any thing from
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106962:102"/>Chriſt, and did not <hi>communicate his uncommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicablenes;</hi> And with all things his power: then <hi>God</hi> would be ſome <hi>where where Chriſt</hi> is not; or <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſome where where <hi>God</hi> is not.</p>
            <p>Or if Chriſt had power without, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; then he would be ſome thing that the Father is not: If the Father were not in ſubjection with the Son, the Son would be ſome thing that the Father is not. If I did not give you that power that I have by my <hi>ſpirit,</hi> I ſhould ſtill be ſomething without you. And if you ſhould be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector, and I not ſervant; then would you be ſome thing without me; which I cannot indure.</p>
            <p>I be nothing but what you are: and you ſhall be nothing but what I am. There would ſtill be ſome jarres between us, if there wrre any thing un-made-over, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given.</p>
            <p>If thou did eſt not take every thing that we have into Thee, and ſet it on high; we could not be exalted. And if thou did'ſt not take our meannes and ſubjection upon Thee, and walk in the fleſh; we could not enjoy Thee.</p>
            <p>Heer's another reaſon. <hi>As the woman is of the man, ſo the man is by the woman: but all things of God.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt, Thus: Man is by the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the ſtubſtance, in Jeſus Chriſt: As <hi>Wiſdome borne of a woman.</hi> He is therefore called <hi>the Sonne of Man,</hi> deſcended from Man.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſcends from God in a way of deſcending (the Father begets the Sonne;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106962:103"/>the Son begets us) ſo the Sonne ariſeth out of us. The Father out of him.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Chriſt receives ſubſtance from the Father,</hi> and we from him: ſo <hi>Chriſt ariſeth</hi> out of us: The Father out of him. And as we bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row our ſelves of him; ſo he is borrowed out of us.</p>
            <p>As by his travel we are brought forth, he labours ſix daies and brings forth <hi>us;</hi> ſo by our labor he is brought forth by us. And he doth as freely confeſſe us to be his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as he is willing to be our Father. He hath his originall from us, and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that it is his glory, that he hath his birth, rice and growth out of ſuch a poore mean ſtock and root as Man. Jeſus Chriſt is by <hi>us; he is of man, he is called the Son of man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Nan is in the World, then <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then God: as God is firſt in <hi>Heaven,</hi> then <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then Man. And ſo if ye will take the point of the loweſt from the Earth: Then firſt, Man is begotten; Man is; Man lives; and after man is, then comes Chriſt borne of Man: an age after Man, the ſecond unto unto Man: when <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath lived heer a time; then is God.</p>
            <p>As we are of him, ſo he is of us: —<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo is the man by the woman</hi>]</p>
            <pb n="184" facs="tcp:106962:104"/>
            <p>God doth ſo empty Himſelf of all that he hath into the Son, that he doth as it were receive a new being from the Sonne.</p>
            <p>God doth ſo love <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that he doth deny himſelfe for his ſake. <hi>I doe even ſpoyle my ſelf of my glory, my Son, to empty it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee. I doe diveſt my ſelf of my glory, to put it upon and in thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes and empties himſelfe by his <hi>humiliation</hi> into us. <hi>I will powre out my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome into you. I will ſuffer my Kingdome to be wholly emptied into fleſh, into man. And the next Kingdome that I have, ſhall be in Man, in you. And if I am not emptied enough into you by my incarnation, then Ile come forth on the croſſe and be ſlain, that I might be more in you. And the glory that I had diſtinct from you, I have loſt it.

            <p>And then, when our Lord Jeſus hath brought us into ſubjection, and ſlain us.

            <p>There are three things to bee meaſured: <hi>The Temple, the Alter, and they that Worſhip therein.</hi> The Lord hath afforded his preſence in the mid'ſt of that generall Anti-chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Apoſtacie that hath befallen the Church.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Temple</hi> is the preſence of God, the indwelling of God with his People; or ſuch a meaſure of the Spirit of the Lord in his People, as makes them a fit Temple for the Lord to dwell in.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Alter</hi> is ſuch a preſence of God, as makes us kill and, ſlay, and ſhed the bloud of thoſe beaſts that are in the Church.</p>

            <p>They in whom GOD dwels, in whom God kils and crucifies fleſh, They are the Temple; They are the Alter; They are the true Worſhippers of GOD. This is that which muſt be <hi>meaſured; the Temple, the Alter, and they that worſhip therein.</hi>

            <p>The firſt Witneſſe is <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the fleſh, teſtifying in weakneſſe, in lowneſſe, in meanneſſe; and this is the <hi>Olive tree on the left hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other Witneſſe is, <hi>Chriſt in ſpirit,</hi> in more power and glory, teſtifying, or bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Witneſſe to GOD, in more brightneſſe, ſtrength and power; and this is <hi>The Olive tree on the right hand, Chriſt</hi> in Majeſtie, <hi>Chriſt</hi> exalted.</p>

            <p>Such is the wiſdome of GOD, that when he will have the <hi>holy City, the outward court</hi> left to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> to worldly Profeſſours, to be trodden under foot, it's for ſo many <hi>moneths:</hi> Its for a ſpace of time, meaſured by the <hi>Moon. —But he will give to his two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to propheſie by daies.

A <hi>day</hi> is meaſured by the <hi>Sun,</hi> as a <hi>moneth</hi> is by the <hi>Moon.</hi> And it is to be obſerved, that though the <hi>propheſying</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> be reckoned by ſhorter and quicker ſpaces, <hi>daies</hi> being ſhorter then <hi>moneths;</hi> yet is for a ſpeciall reaſon; to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify that this time of the <hi>propheſying</hi> of the <hi>witneſſes,</hi> is a <hi>day-time:</hi> it's a day; <hi>the day of the Lord.</hi>

            <p>When the outward <hi>Court is trampled under foot by the Gentiles forty two moneths,</hi> then the two <hi>witneſſes</hi> are propheſying a thouſand two hundred and ſixty <hi>daies.</hi> I wil give you a particular reaſon why the time of the <hi>witneſſes propheſying</hi> is reckoned by <hi>daies.</hi> It is to note the infinite variety of diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the <hi>propheſying</hi> of the <hi>witneſſes:</hi> In which time are many ſweet, bright ſhining daies; many excellent diſcoveries; many glorious <hi>myſteries,</hi> are voutſafed unto the People of God, in the time of <hi>their propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> and yet the nature of <hi>their propheſie</hi> is, <hi>They are cloathed in ſackcloth:</hi> It is a darke, mournfull expreſſion, holding forth thus much; That they are in a dark, low, courſe, ſad, mean, and poor <hi>eſtate,</hi> and but <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying</hi> neither.</p>
            <p>The <hi>LORD</hi> comes and ſets up his two <hi>witneſſes,</hi> Chriſt in <hi>fleſh,</hi> and Chriſt in <hi>ſpirit.</hi> He gives two witneſſes of himſelf: the <hi>fleſh</hi> of Chriſt, and the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Chriſt; the one to be <hi>crucified,</hi> the other to revive; the one <hi>propheſying</hi> and foretelling what ſhall
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:106962:111"/>be, in ſackcloth; in a very dark, low, mean eſtate: the other <hi>propheſying</hi> and fore-telling heavenly things to come.

            </p>
            <p>Some again interpret them to be the two Teſtaments, the old and the new; which they call, <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel.</hi> A remote and dark figure, ſtill of <hi>Ghriſt</hi> in fleſh and Spirit. <hi>Chriſt</hi> in fleſh, having much in it of the nature of the old Teſtament; <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Spirit, the new man, <hi>the LORD from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> having much in it of the nature of the new <hi>Covenant</hi> or new Teſtament.</p>
            <p>But it's generally underſtood to be the Saints of God, and (to ſpeake in proper language) theſe are the Saints of God, or the holy ones of God, <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Spirit: <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the fleſh, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Spirit, where theſe two are bearing witneſſe in any, they are the Saints of God, they are the holy ones of God; Theſe are the <hi>two Olive trees</hi> ſpoken of, and the two <hi>anointed ones that ſtand by the Lord of the whole earth.</hi> Zech. 4. <hi>laſt verſe.

            <p>Theſe Prophets have the Power of God, and all the Power of GOD; and can <hi>ſmite the Earth</hi> with what <hi>Plagues they will.</hi> I have found them Smiting the Earth with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, ſpirituall ſickneſſes, weakneſſes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, leproſies, plague-ſores, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-ſores, famine, death, warres, feares, frightings, amazments, wild-beaſts; with all theſe Plagues.

               <hi>And when they ſhall have finiſhed their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the beaſt that aſcendeth out of the bottomleſſe pit, ſhall make warre againſt them, and ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some them, and kill them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a time to Witneſſe, and a time to Finiſh their work; and you have it here Propheſied, that they muſt firſt Finiſh their Teſtimony, and that they ſhall bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and killed; but not before they have finiſhed their Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But How muſt they be killed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The beaſt that aſcends out of the bottomleſſe pit ſhall made warre againſt them, and kill them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Beaſt which aſcends out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe pit, is Antichriſt. Many ſpeake of the ſlaying of the Witneſſes, and it is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peoples mouthes now, which doth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly foretell (though in them very dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ſomething that is to come. But firſt let me tel you, that that which ſhall kill them muſt Aſcend out of the Bottomleſſe pit. It ſhall bee no outward, or viſible force that ſhall ſlay theſe two Witneſſes: It ſhall bee by no viſible Power of Kings or Princes, Papiſts or Malignants, that theſe Witneſſes ſhall be killed: no, we may ſee to the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:106962:116"/>of al theſe. That which ſhall ſlay theſe two Witneſſes, ſhall Aſcend from a pit that hath no Bottom; that is, There ſhall ſuch helliſh fins, ſuch Hideous Monſtrous darkneſſe, ſuch filthy Beaſtlineſſe, ariſe in the mindes and ſpirits of men, that ſhall fight againſt the very Light of Chriſt, and the Spirit of Chriſt in His People: But theſe Witneſſes are above the rage, and reach of all viſible Powers. They may indeed kill and ſlay the bodies of men, and after that can doe no more; for (alas) that is not that which is <hi>here</hi> ſlain; But <hi>the two Olive Trees, Chriſt</hi> in Feſh and Spirit: And that which kills them is a Beaſt, a Beaſtlineſſe below the Beaſtlineſſe of man; It's not man, it's by no power of man; It's Beaſtly darkneſſe, Beaſtly luſts, Helliſh wickedneſs; ſuch as ariſeth from a Pit that hath no <hi>bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom;</hi> ſuch as you cannot tel whence it is, nor what it is; ſuch as hath not been viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly manifeſt amongſt the Sons of men. Ye ſhall ſee yet more abominable, helliſh, hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious beaſtly, black wickedneſſe, then ever yet appeared.</p>
            <p>Ye cannot <hi>yet</hi> tel the <hi>Father</hi> of theſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes: Ye are able to ſay, ſuch and ſuch wickedneſſes comes from the Pope; ſuch
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:106962:116"/>and ſuch from Jeſuites and Papiſts; ſuch and ſuch from your owne hearts: But yee ſhall finde ſuch black helliſh wickedneſſe, ſuch diſorder and confuſion, ſuch torment, ſuch diſquietment, ſuch ignorance, ſuch baſe ignorance, come out of a Pit deeper, and darker, and filthyer then hath yet been found out amongſt the ſons of men; ſuch as is without length, or breadth; ſuch as is not to be fathomed, or meaſured; ſuch a <hi>pit</hi> ſhal be opened, and ſuch darkneſſe come in to the world, as never before appeared: ſuch as ſhall be blacker, and baſer, and fouler, then hitherto hath been brought forth.</p>
            <p>And theſe ſhall make <hi>warre</hi> againſt the Witneſſes, and overcome <hi>them:</hi> Firſt, fight, then overcome and kill them. Firſt, oppoſe the light of the <hi>LORD,</hi> the Spirit of the <hi>LORD</hi> Chriſt. I ſay, oppoſe theſe <hi>two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> and <hi>teſtimonies</hi> of the preſence of the LORD; of GOD dwelling in fleſh, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fleſh, offering up fleſh upon the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> Theſe ſhal be oppoſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>overcome them, and kill them:</hi> There is a continuall oppoſition of the <hi>Death,</hi> and of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt; and of Chriſt Riſen in us; of GOD dwelling with us, and in us. And there ſhal ſuch a darkneſſe,

Theſe <hi>Olive trees</hi> ſhall not give forth their <hi>Oyle;</hi> they ſhall not bee able to ſpeake their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in you; ye ſhal not enjoy thoſe ſweet inward refreſhings, that ſome times yee have had.</p>
            <p>The Witneſſes ſhal be <hi>overcome, killed and ſlain:</hi> ſuch hidious, monſterous darkneſſe ſhal ariſe in you, that yee ſhall not know that yee have the Spirit of <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> dwels in you: ye ſhal not be able to ſee, or ſay, that yee have the preſence of God with you; that ye have the preſence of theſe two Olive trees, <hi>Emptying their Golden Oyle</hi> into you: Al their opperations ſhal be quite <hi>kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſlain and dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>—And their dead bodies ſhall lye in the ſtreets of the great City, which ſpiritually is called So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Egypt, where alſo our Lord was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</q>
            <p>The place of the dead bodies, is the <hi>ſtreets of the great City, Babylon.</hi> The world govern'd by Satan, the god of the world,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:106962:117"/>is Babylon.

            <p>Yee ſhal have ſtrange workings of the Devill, and Satan, in the ſtreets of the <hi>great City,</hi> when the Witneſſes are killed, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their carcaſſes, formes and figures, ſpiritleſs and life-leſs: And this is the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes of the fleſh Heightened.</p>
            <p>There are theſe two Streets in the great City, Sodom, and Egypt, that will bee found in you, though they doe not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare: The filthineſſe of Sodom, pride, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, fulneſſe of bread, and abundance of Idleneſſe.

            <q>—Where alſo our Lord was Crucified]</q>
            <p>Our <hi>Lord</hi> was Crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, or according to the Letter; But ſpiritually it was in <hi>Sodom and Egypt:</hi> It was the filthy wickedneſſe of Sodom, and the curſed enmity of Egypt, that Crucified

The Remembrance and ſight of theſe, is their very life; therefore they <hi>will not ſuffer them to bee put in graves:</hi> to bee buried out of their ſight. They keep up al outward, and fleſhly formes above ground as long as they can. It is their life, their peace, their comfort, their joy; they are glad that the Spirit and life is gon, that was wont to vex and torment them.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:106962:120"/>—After three daies and a half]</q>
            <p>This is expreſſed elſe-where, by a <hi>time, times, and half a time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, A <hi>Time,</hi> that's one day. Then <hi>times,</hi> that's two daies. Then half a <hi>time,</hi> or the diviſion of time, that's half a day. The meaning is this.

            </p>
            <p>It will be but a day and two daies and half a day: or a <hi>time, times,</hi> and half a <hi>time,</hi> and then they ſhall riſe again.</p>
            <p>In this ſad condition there will be an expectation of a quick and ſudden delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

A <hi>day</hi> wherein ye ſhall know 'tis <hi>day.</hi> A <hi>day</hi> wherein ſhall be an expectation of a ſeaſonable and ſweet deliverance.</p>
            <p>But then (alas) there are yet two <hi>dries</hi> and half a <hi>day,</hi> wherein it will grow more dark; there will be multiplied evils; there will be diviſion of times. Now (ſaith the Soul) let it be when God will; I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented

            </p>
            <q>—And the Spirit of life from God entered into them]</q>
            <p>There is not true life, but by the Spirit of life which is in God. When the Spirit of the holy God comes into us, then we live, that's a life in deed. Before, it was the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>God</hi> working in a poor, low, ſad <hi>ſtate;</hi> it was a life in <hi>ſack-cloth;</hi> a mournfull, a dying life: a life next the grave. But when the Spirit of life from God, the Spirit of

            <p>An expreſſion of joy and rejoycing: and this is the wickedneſſe of earthly People, that dwell in the Earth, that dwell in the World; they have no peace, no joy, longer then they get the maſtery of the Spirit of

            <p>In theſe three verſes following is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of the two <hi>witneſſes.</hi>

            <p>When theſe two <hi>witneſſes</hi> ſhall appear in any, ſhall finiſh their <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> bee killed and ſlain; they ſhall ly dead three daies and an halfe (or, as it is expreſt in the next chapter of the Womans being in the <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe</hi>) <hi>for a time, times and half a time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time of the killing of the <hi>witneſſes,</hi> ſhall be a time of great joy and rejoycing to them that dwell one the Earth; eartly Chriſtians, carnall Chriſtians: Yet there ſhall be in it a day. Jeſus Chriſt makes the grave a day: There is a quiet reſt, and a ſweet day in the death of Chriſt, in the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:106962:124"/>of the <hi>witneſſes:</hi> and though in it ſelf it be very grievious and terrible; yet you ſhal ſee brightneſſe and glory, ſhinings and twinklings forth of light, ſo that ye ſhall be able to call it a day.</p>
            <p>But there is a <hi>day</hi> and two <hi>daies,</hi> and half a <hi>day,</hi> or a <hi>time, times and half a time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt a day and ſeaſon in which there ſhall be a comfortable expectation of a ſeaſonable and ſpeedy deliverance, where-we are able to ſay, Theſe <hi>witneſſes</hi> are now ſlain; but they ſhall ſpeedily revive and riſe again.</p>
            <p>After that comes <hi>times,</hi> or two <hi>daies,</hi> wherein there will be leſſe expectation, and more trouble; multiplied evils, time devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and then there ſhall not be ſuch an expectation of a ſpeedy deliverance as was before. The Soul ſhall be able to ſay, I ſhall be delivered, but I know not when: for <hi>ought</hi> that appears I may lie long in this ſtate; but I will waite with patience; I will ſubmit to the will of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Then after this there's half a <hi>day,</hi> or a ſeaſon wherein there ſhall be a ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving, an unexpected deliverance. <hi>A ſhort work will the Lord make on the Earth.</hi>

            <q>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:106962:125"/>—The Spirit of life from God entred into them]</q>
            <p>They had before but the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie <hi>(The Spirit of Propheſie is the teſtimony of Jeſus)</hi> wherein, though they live'd, yet their life was but a ſaying they ſhould live: but a fore-telling of a higher, and further ſtate of life to come: but now they have a Spirit of life—<hi>The Spirit of life from God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into them.</hi> Not the Spirit of propheſie only, but the <hi>Spirit of life:</hi> not only to bee able to fore-tel what they ſhould be, but what they are; That they are righteous, holy, happy; that they <hi>live.</hi> Yea, not only to be able to ſay they <hi>live,</hi> but to be <hi>life</hi> it ſelf. Not only to Propheſie in <hi>ſack-cloth;</hi> to be under a <hi>vaile;</hi> but by the <hi>re-entry</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of life into them;</hi> to ſee <hi>GOD</hi> opening, and un-vailing his <hi>face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Witneſſes muſt, and wil Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie before they <hi>live:</hi> Firſt, wear <hi>ſack-cloth,</hi> Propheſie darkly, that they ſhal <hi>live,</hi> then <hi>live.</hi> Firſt, be in expectation and Propheſie of live, then <hi>live:</hi> firſt, beleive, hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, then <hi>live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We never loſe any thing, but we gain
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:106962:125"/>by it. If we loſe the Spirit of propheſie, we gaine the Spirit of life for it: we gaine by ſufferings; we gaine by loſing.</p>
            <p>If a ſpirit of darkneſes aſcend out of the bottomleſſe pit, clouding our comfort, we receive a better Spirit for it—<hi>The Spirit of life from God:</hi> and ſo are gainers. This we may be aſſured of, for the <hi>LORD</hi> ſaith it. <hi>He will not leave my ſoul in hell, nor ſuffer his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one to ſee corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may be brought to the death, we may bee killed and ſlain, wee may be dead carcaſſes; <hi>But where the carcaſſe is, thither will the Eagles bee gathered together.</hi> Thither this <hi>Eagle</hi> (the Divine Spirit of <hi>GOD</hi>) doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort: to this Carcaſſe (I ſay) to Revive it.</p>
            <p>This heavenly Eagle, or Spirit of GOD, comes and eats up all the deadlineſs, all the corruption, all the Carcaſs; that he in us, might live in the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no true <hi>life,</hi> but the <hi>Spirit of life.</hi> Then may we ſay we <hi>live,</hi> when we <hi>live</hi> in the Spirit of <hi>GOD:</hi> this is called the <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit. The firſt Man was made a living ſoul, the Second was made a quickning Spirit.</hi> Man is a living ſoul, a living creature; and it is the Spirit of GOD that makes him
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:106962:126"/>to <hi>live</hi> a Spiritual <hi>life:</hi> but when that life is killed and ſlain, then he hath a ſecond <hi>life</hi> for it; a better <hi>life, The Spirit of life,</hi> life it <hi>ſelfe;</hi> true <hi>life</hi> indeed. And we know no life, no true <hi>life,</hi> but in the <hi>LORD, our life.</hi> —<hi>When HE who is O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R life, ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>While the Witneſſes propheſie, they cannot ſay that they <hi>live;</hi> but when they have received the <hi>Spirit of life,</hi> then they can truly ſay they <hi>live:</hi> Now they can claime that title, <hi>I was dead, but am alive. I am the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and the life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no true life til there be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; til then it's but a ſtate of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity: It is not yet <hi>life:</hi> But when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, and riſe again, <hi>mortallity is ſwallowed up of life:</hi> now we live indeed.</p>
            <p>That's true life that is not ſubject to death; that is true life, that cannot be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>That life that is under the Power of death, that is under the Command of death, that can be extinguiſhed by death, is no true <hi>life.</hi> Its <hi>life</hi> to be ſet free from <hi>death;</hi> to be diſ-engaged and diſ-obliged from the command of this King of fears: when we can ſay, <hi>O death! Where is thy ſting? O grave!
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:106962:126"/>Where is thy victory?</hi> When wee can tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon death; that is <hi>life,</hi> true Life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            <q>—The Spirit of life from God]</q>
            <p>True life conſiſts in a continual flowing forth from God, a daily powring out of the Divine <hi>life,</hi> the <hi>Divine nature</hi> into us; enlivening and quickning all our actions and ſervices.</p>
            <p>Thoſe are not living actions, living ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, living performances, that flow not from the <hi>life</hi> of GOD in us. We live when every thing we act or ſpeak flows from the life of God in us: Then wee <hi>live,</hi> when al we do comes from GOD, when <hi>God</hi> ſends it forth, God ſpeakes it, God doth it; then they are living words, living acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons—<hi>In thy preſence is life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The abſence of the ſoul from the body, is the ſhadow (and but the ſhadow) of <hi>death;</hi> but the abſence of GOD from a thing, or perſon, that's <hi>death,</hi> Spiritual <hi>death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You cannot ſay a man lives, except you ſee his ſoul act, move, ſpeak &amp;c. If yee were Chriſtians indeed, ye would not ſay <hi>you live,</hi> until <hi>yee</hi> hear the voice of <hi>GOD</hi> ſaying to <hi>you,</hi> This is the way of God, theſe are the words and works of God. There
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:106962:127"/>is life true life indeed. The reviving and life of theſe two <hi>witneſſes</hi> is the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the life, the life of the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>God comes forth in theſe two, in the Son and in the Spirit; the fulnes of God ſhewing it ſelf in the fleſh of Chriſt and the Spirit of Chriſt, this is life. Theſe three are all in union together, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> in one conjunction and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Father</hi> puting forth himſelf in the <hi>Son</hi> by the <hi>Spirit:</hi> The <hi>Father</hi> acting, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and inlivening the <hi>Son,</hi> by the <hi>Spirit;</hi> theſe mutually imbracing each other, is our life.</p>
            <p>Concerning this reſurrection of the <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> obſerve, that it is graduall, The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of life from God firſt entred into them; after that they live: there was a kinde of abſence before; but now a preſence of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>The holy God ſuffers a kinde of parting to be between himſelf and his Son; ney, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt himſelf and his own Spirit which is himſelf; and after this again there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniting. Firſt, There muſt be an entrance, The Spirit of God firſt enters into them, then they live.</p>
            <pb n="231" facs="tcp:106962:127"/>
            <p>The <hi>Reſurrection</hi> though it be quick, though it be in a moment, <hi>in the twinkling of an eye,</hi> yet it is graduall.</p>
            <p>Firſt, There is an entrance of the Spirit; <hi>The Spirit of life from God entered into them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a double effect of this entering of the Spirit.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>They ſtood upon their feet.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>They heard a great voiyce ſaying, Come up hither.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, The Spirit of the Lord entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; while they are dead, while their <hi>dead bodies were lying in the ſtreets of the great City,</hi> the breath of <hi>life from God entered into them.</hi> And this is very certain, we ſhall not loſe any thing that we have had. Though the Lord withdraw himſelfe from us a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, yet he will returne to us again, and then he wil gather up al that is ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and enter into all that's dead.</p>
            <q>—And they ſtood upon their feet]</q>
            <p>This is the ſecond gradation, or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond degree of their <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> which is two-fold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They could own the Lord, they could ſay, The Lord is with us; our God
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106962:128"/>is with us, and in us. <hi>Life</hi> is come to us. We are the holy ones of God. We are the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en candleſticks, upon whom the light of God doth ſhine. This is the Spirit of life from our God.</p>
            <p>And then ſecondly, they are raiſed from the earth; and ſo raiſed as that they can ſtand upon their feet; an expreſſion of the dry bones, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. into whom when the breath of the Lord came, they lived, they ſtood upon their feet, an exceeding great Army. So the Prophet <hi>Ezekel</hi> when he was overcome by the glory of God in the great viſion he ſaw <hi>chapter</hi> 2. it's ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord entred into him, and he ſtood upon his feet.</hi> And ſo <hi>Daniel</hi> was raiſed, <hi>chapter</hi> 10.10, 11. <hi>O, Daniel, a man greatly beloved! un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the words that I ſpeak unto thee, and ſtand upright:</hi> Which is the ſame with this: <hi>The Spirit of the Lord intring into us,</hi> ſtanding up in us, manifeſting and ſhewing what wee are, making us viſibly to appear the <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones of God;</hi> inabling us to ſtand up and own a heavenly and ſpiritual life and <hi>light,</hi> to appear, to ariſe, to ſhew our ſelves, that we are the holy ones of God.</p>
            <p>And though whileſt wee were ſlain and dead we could not owne the Lord, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:106962:128"/>him; we could not confeſſe the Lord, who he was, and what he was, becauſe we were in death and darkneſſe: yet now having the Spirit of the Lord entred into us; we now being raiſed from the dead, we ſtand up and are able to ſay, Wee are the Lords; wee are the holy anointed ones of God.</p>
            <p>There is <hi>life</hi> and ſtrength and confidence appearing in the <hi>witneſſes</hi> ſtanding upon their feet, ſo that they can ſay, We (by this life or in this life of God) are able to live amonſt men, to walk about in the Name of the Lord; to owne and confeſſe God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men; and with confidence to looke men in the face; <hi>Hell</hi> in the face; Devils in the face: To out-look, out-ſpeak, out-act, all our adverſaries. To ſay, We live, and God lives in us. We dare owne our ſelves what we are; We dare go up and down, and act and ſpeak in the Name of our God.</p>
            <q>—And they ſtood upon their feet]</q>
            <p>Time was, that the glory of God was carried about upon the ſhoulders of men. The Prophets did teſtifie and witnes in the ſtrength and by the ſtrength of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:106962:129"/>and in and by the meanes and uſe of ſome creature, gifts, parts, Scriptures, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and ſuch like things, wherein God ſtood upon the ſhoulders of man; upon the feet of man; was upheld and borne up by the ſtrength, power and authority of the creature; by reaſon, by judgement, by opinion, by ſtrength of argument <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this they are now <hi>dead</hi> unto, and now there appears in them a high, a more excellent way: the <hi>witneſſes</hi> (Chriſt in <hi>fleſh</hi> and Spirit) ſtand now upon their own feet; upon their own ſtrength, ſimply and immediatly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own ſtrength and power, not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon cratckes of man, the wiſdome of man, the ſtrength of man, the parts of man; not borrowing <hi>ought</hi> from any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but ſtanding barely upon their <hi>ſtrength,</hi> their own <hi>power,</hi> their own <hi>authority:</hi> And becauſe they are the Saints of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for they ſtand and require not helpe from creatures. Now they can ſay, This autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity God gives us; this power doth God adminiſter to <hi>us,</hi> and this <hi>we</hi> dare challenge and claim, being the holy ones of God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the anointed ones of God. We need no ſtrength from others; wee care for no crartches; wee lean upon none; wee ſtand
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106962:129"/>barely and ſimply upon the ſtrength and power of our God. We need no arguments to confirme us; no reaſons to parſwade us; no authority of men to ſtrengthen us; wee ſtand upon our own feet; we dare ſay, Heer we are in the Name of our God. Becauſe we are, we are: becauſe we llve, wee live; And becauſe we are the anointed of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we act, therefore we ſpeak, therefore we live, and upon no other account at all.</p>
            <q>— And they ſtood upon their feet]</q>
            <p>They yet are upon the Earth, and have not wholly put off their earthlines; <hi>though</hi> they are able to live, to act, to ſpeak in the Name of the Lord, yet they goe upon the ground. Though they need not cratches, yet they ſtand upon the Earth.</p>
            <p>Afterwards they aſcended up into <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> into a higher and more ſpirituall life then this; when they hear that great voyce from Heaven, <hi>Come up hither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Feet, the lower and inferiour part of the body, are alwaies ſubject to defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by dirt and filth of the Earth, for they have continually fellowſhip with the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:106962:130"/>Earth. But theſe <hi>two witneſſes</hi> though living in the earth, though ſtanding upon the Earth, yet have ſome fellowſhip with the Lord of Heaven.</p>
            <p>—<hi>And great fear fell upon them that ſaw them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Earthly men, and they that dwell onely on the Earth, when the <hi>witneſſes</hi> are ſlaine, they looke and expect that that ſtate of death and darknes wherein they lie ſhould utterly ſwallow them up; O, (ſay they) what a dark, what a ſad condition are they in?</p>
            <p>While the <hi>witneſſes</hi> propheſied and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt the fleſh, againſt the ſtrength and wiſdome of man, earthly men were troubled and caſt down; but when the <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> are ſlain and lie dead in the ſtreets without the actings of the life of God in them: preſently they conclude they are wholly deſtroyed. O, (ſay they) ſee what a ſad ſtate they are in, they are quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, they have loſt their <hi>life,</hi> their <hi>ſtrength,</hi> their <hi>joy,</hi> their <hi>peace,</hi> their <hi>comfort,</hi> they are <hi>dead,</hi> they are gone, there is an end of them. Thus they ſpeak, thinking they ſhall never
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:106962:130"/>revive again. Theſe are the thoughts, and this is the language of earthly men: but when they ſee them ſtand up upon their feet, revive and live again, O, this ſtrikes them to the very heart: to ſee the Lord ſtanding upon the Earth, owning himſelf in his People, is terrible and dreadfull to earthly men: the glorious appearance of God, ſtrikes man to the very heart: O, I ſhall dye, I <hi>have ſeen the Lord.</hi> So <hi>Daniel</hi> when he ſaw the Lord, he fell upon his face. So <hi>Job,</hi> when his eyes had ſeen the Lord, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented in ſack-coth and aſhes. And know this, that the reviving grace, the reviving Spirit of the Lord, bringing up his holy ones from the depths of temptations and troubles, to a ſtate of life and joy, is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to the world, a terrour to them that ſee it: When any thing of the appearance of God, of the clear brightnes of the Lord breaks forth, and ſpeaks thus; <hi>I am the Lord, the holy one of God;</hi> man cannot ſtand, he fears, he trembles, he fals down as dead: when men live onely in the light and ſtrength of God, then great feare fals on them that ſee them.</p>
            <pb n="222" facs="tcp:106962:131"/>
            <p>— <hi>Great fear fell upon them</hi>]</p>
            <p>It fals irreſiſtably, they cannot avoid it; every creature that is earthly, within or without, <hi>Fear</hi> fals upon them, <hi>Fear</hi> ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth them, at the reviving of the <hi>witneſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know paleneſſe and ſadneſſe, fears and aſtoniſhments, and great troubles, fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fleſh of man: It hath upon me, and it doth upon the fleſh of man, and upon al that hear any thing of the tidings of the appearing of Jeſus <hi>Chriſt:</hi> I ſay, The revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the <hi>witneſſes,</hi> the enterance of the life of God into them; the quickning, the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt in the Spirit: <hi>God</hi> being in man, and man being in God; this <hi>life</hi> of God ſtrikes <hi>horrour, terrour,</hi> and <hi>amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> into the hearts of earthly and carnall men: It fals upon them like a <hi>Milſtone</hi> it breaks them to peeces, it grinds them to powder.</p>
            <p>Men are weak things, poore things, baſe things, fearfull things, guilty things, and therefore fearfull things; full of bondage and ſlaviſh fear.</p>
            <p>The leaſt appearance of the high power and glory of God, doth <hi>affright, ſtartle</hi> and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:106962:131"/>
               <hi>confound</hi> rhe <hi>ſtrongeſt,</hi> the noſt <hi>ſtout-harted</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men. No man, no earthly man, no fleſhly man, <hi>Dares, Dares</hi> look upon God when he appears.</p>
            <p>While man is able to ſay, it is not God; while he is able (as he thinks) to ſhut his eyes againſt him and not ſee him, he may pleaſe himſelf (at leaſt a while) in having a little peace, and perſwade himſelfe that he ſhall doe well: but this appearance of God is ſo ſharpe, ſo bright, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, muſt not, ſhall not be able to ſhut his eyes: <hi>poſſibly he may doe as a man that ſhuts his eyes</hi> againſt the Sun: the man that lies in the Sun, though he doth ſhut his eyes as faſt, as cloſe as he is able, yet the bright beames of the Sun, doe ſo pierce and work into his eyes that he doth ſee, do what he can. So when men ſay, This is not Chriſt; this is not the Spirit: yet the bright <hi>beames</hi> of the Sun of <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> do ſo pierce into their eyes, into their hearts, that (I know) they ſee, and connot but ſee, and ſay, This is the Lord; and they tremble.</p>
            <p>— <hi>And I heard a great voyce ſaying, Come up hither]</hi>

            <p>When we are alive we hear the <hi>voyce</hi> of

               <hi>There are thee that bear witnes in heaven,</hi> and by theſe three, is every word <hi>eſtabliſht:</hi> The <hi>Father, the Son and the Spirit; each of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſufficiency to confirm each other; and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to put an end to all controverſies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You heard in the morning that there were ſeverall degrees of the reviving of the <hi>witneſſes,</hi> the firſt degree is the entering of the Spirit of life from God into them, which cauſed them to ſtand <hi>upon their feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, They heard a <hi>great Voyce from Heaven,</hi> calling them up, <hi>Come up hither.</hi>

            <p>And thirdly, There is their Aſcention into <hi>Heaven: They were taken up in a cloud, and their enemies beheld them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the 13, <hi>verſe,</hi> there is the effect of al this. <hi>In the ſame hour there was a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and the tenth part of the City fell:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe works of God are not yet pure, though they are very excellent. Though there be a <hi>Reſurrestion</hi> and <hi>Aſcention</hi> into <hi>heaven;</hi> yet it is <hi>in a cloud,</hi> covered with ſome infirmity and darkneſſe; and yet in this there is the greateſt glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the ſame hour was an Earthquake</hi>]</p>
            <p>Or (to ſpeak the language of God elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) <hi>A rejoycing with trembling.</hi>

            <p>In the greateſt appearance and manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:106962:136"/>of God, ſo long as there is any Earth it Trembleth: and indeed, the more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the diſcoveries of God are, the greater the <hi>Earthquake.</hi> No Earth can be without moving and trouble, that bears the weight of the glory of God upon it</p>
            <p>In this hour of <hi>aſcention,</hi> there is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſome ſecret rejoycing; and ſome trouble occaſioned by the <hi>Earthquake;</hi> or elſe take the Earth heer as diſtinct from the <hi>witneſſes,</hi> and then their <hi>aſcending</hi> up from the Earth, makes the Earth to ſhake. Chriſt and the Spirit of God, thoſe two <hi>witneſſes</hi> are the ſtreneth and ſtability of the Earth; yea, the ſtrength of the Pillars of the Earth: I <hi>uphold the Pillars of the Earth</hi> ſaith the Lord: He it is that ſtrengthens the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth. And therefore when theſe <hi>witneſſes,</hi> the ſtrength and Pillars of the Earth, <hi>aſcend</hi> and remove from it, the Earth muſt needs quake and tremble.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The witneſſes are the corner ſtone of the World;</hi> It was by the word of the Lord, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall word, that the Worlds were made, that the Worlds are ſupported: therefore when this Word of the Lord <hi>Aſcends</hi> out of the World, the World muſt needs ſhake.</p>
            <p>The whole World hath lived and leaned upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Spirit of Chriſt, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:106962:137"/>now his ariſing and removall out of the World, muſt needs prove the ruine and downfall of the World. All your ſtrength, peace and comfort, hath been borrowed of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and now his leaving the World, and carrying the Pillars of the World with him (as <hi>Sampſon</hi> the Gates of the City) makes all the World fall to confuſion.</p>
            <p>— <hi>A great Earthquake</hi>]</p>
            <p>The naturall cauſe of an <hi>Earthquake,</hi> is the wind pent up in the bowels of the Earth, which ſeeking vent, breakes forth and ſo ſhakes the Earth. So the Spirit, or breath, or wind of the Lord, pent up in the bowels of the Earth, ſhut up amongſt earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men (as the Son a Man was three daies and three nights in the heart or bowels of of the Earth) when it breaks forth it ſhakes and rends the World: And this is the cauſe of the <hi>Earthquake</hi> and <hi>commotions</hi> that are now abroad in the World: The <hi>breaking</hi> forth, or <hi>aſcending</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God out of the World.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Earthquake</hi> is one of the greateſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities and evils that can befall the <hi>world;</hi> the Earth being the <hi>Center</hi> and ſtay of man. The very <hi>bottome</hi> and foundation upon which all the <hi>camfort</hi> and <hi>good</hi> of the life of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:106962:137"/>man ſtands. When this <hi>center,</hi> this reſt or ſtay, this foundation ſhakes, nothing more affrightens, and aſtoniſhes man.</p>
            <p>Theſe Witneſſes aſcending out of the world, the Bottom and Foundation of peoples ſtrength and comfort trembles and quakes: the root of al humane life is cut inſunder at once: the bottom of al humane joy is taken away: The foundation of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and Civil power is ſhaken; the ground-worke of all earthly ſtability and comfort, of Church and Comon-wealth quakes and trembles; I ſay, the world is loſing the foundation and ground-work upon which Religion and Civil-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtands; and this makes the Earth to <hi>ſhake.</hi>

            <p>—<hi>And the tenth part of the City fell</hi>]</p>
            <p>This City is Babylon, called the holy City. This holy City is trampled under foot, as you may read in the ſecond <hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter.</hi> This holy City, or the outward Court, is left to bee poſſeſſed by the men of the world, by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, by <hi>men uncircumciſed in heart and ſpirit;</hi> by fleſhly and carnal men: This is the fate of this City.</p>

            <p>—<hi>The tenth part]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The tenth part (you know) was the <hi>Levits</hi> part, which was holy to the LORD, or dedicated to the LORD; it was offered up to the <hi>Priests</hi> under the Law, it was the chiefe maintenance of the legal prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>And here the tenth part of the City, the chiefeſt part, the devoted part (as you ſay) Gods inheritance, the lot and portion of the Prieſt-hood, this part <hi>of the City fell;</hi> in ſumme, the holyeſt, the chiefeſt, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenteſt <hi>part of the City fell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The waies of worldly Propheſſors and Chriſtians, are ſomthing that is holy, ſomthing that is offered up to God, but in the hands of the world, trampled under foot by the world. There is an excellency in this, this is that that's called the tenth part, that part wherein men have thought themſelves moſt ſacred and holy, that which they have offered up to God, that which they have ſeperated from the world and their owne proper uſe, and given to God; ſome of their wiſdome, ſome of their eſtates, ſome of their time, ſome of their

            </p>
            <p>I tel you againe, When theſe two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes aſcend and leave the earth, then the higheſt formes of religion, the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſeperated things of men, thoſe holy things wherein they have moſt devoted themſelves to GOD, and the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> their hours of Praier, their Sabbaths their Faſtings, their Engagements and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants to ſerve the Lord; this tenth part in the Earth quake falls al to the ground: <hi>the tenth part</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Seven thouſand is the perfection of the creature as it is able to be numbered; or it is the multiplying of al the perfections of man; or man numbered into the higheſt perfection, or largeſt number that may be multiplied that is not Infinite, which is God.</p>
            <p>—<hi>Seven thouſand]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seven is a Holy number; and therefore the ſeventh day was ſanctified and made holy.

            <p>Nothing is more frequent in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, where menſion is made of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God (through which he brings his people to ſalvation) then this, That <hi>a remnant ſhall be ſaved, a remnant ſhall be brought through the fire.</hi> Here one and there another, <hi>as the gleanings of the vintage;</hi> like ſmall bunches of <hi>grapes</hi> upon the uppermoſt boughs; a ſmal company, and them not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, <hi>a remnant.</hi>

            <p>The LORD wil waſte and conſume fleſh to a very low ſtate; He wil bring down man to a fragment, to a very ſmall Remnant, til ther's almoſt nothing left; to a ſtate and condition that ſhal not be conſiderable, that ſhal ſcarce be fit for any uſe.</p>
            <p>The thouſands, the ſeven thouſand; the excellenteſt, the greateſt, the richeſt, the moſt numerous, the moſt religious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted part ſhal be ſlain; a <hi>remnant only</hi> ſhal be <hi>left</hi> and thoſe <hi>affrighted</hi> too.</p>
            <p>—<hi>And great fear fell upon them that ſaw them</hi>]</p>
            <p>When they ſaw the LORD aſcending out of Earth, leaving the Earth deſolate;
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:106962:141"/>leaving Religion, Society, Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealthes, to waſting and deſtruction; when they, ſaw ſtability, goodneſs, wiſdome, righteouſnes and holyneſs forſaking the earth, and aſcending up into the holineſs of God, this affrights men; and it affrights them (almoſt out of their wits) to ſee that there is no living amongſt ſuch men; that there is nothing to be ſeen amongſt them but death, horrour and confuſion in the whole creation: And to ſee that if we do not ſubmit to the Lord, live in the Spirit of the Lord, and follow the guidance and conduct of the Spirit of the Lord, we are for ever ruin'd. If we are not able to <hi>aſcend</hi> with theſe Witneſſes, go up with them to Heaven and live with Chriſt and the Spirit of God an heavenly life, we are utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever; we ſhal ſee hel opening her mouth to devour us; miſeries, feares and wrath ready to ceaſe upon us and <hi>ſwallow</hi> us up: therefore if we cannot <hi>aſcend</hi> to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with theſe <hi>witneſſes,</hi> Wo be unto us; for we ſhal ſee <hi>there is no poſſible way of ſubſiſtence out of heaven.</hi> We ſhal ſee much <hi>helliſh wrath</hi> and <hi>darknes</hi> and <hi>confuſion fall</hi> upon men; that they cannot <hi>live</hi> in that ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein they have <hi>lived.</hi>

            <p>—<hi>And they gave glory to the GOD of Heaven]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Strange language, that a Remnant, a poor <hi>affrighted remnant,</hi> ſhould be able to give glory to God. Yet thither we muſt be brought before we can give glory <hi>to the God of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whil'ſt we have any glory left, we give glory to our ſelves, and not to God; but when we are become a Remnant, Affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and daſht in peeces, then ſhal we glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy God.</p>
            <p>We think that men of excellent wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſtrength ſhould glorify GOD, O no, they take from the glory of <hi>God,</hi> and give it to themſelves. We think that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and Parliaments, and Synods, and Councels of great Men, ſhould give glory to God; no, none at all; they give glory to themſelves: None but an <hi>affrighted remnant gives glory to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God neither hath, nor wil have any glory til man be brought to an affrighted Remnant—<hi>they that were affrighted gave glory to God:</hi> Mark it, if you are able to mark it, that ſuch a <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>affrighted rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:106962:142"/>ſhould give glory to the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; that the God of Heaven ſhould receive glory from ſo poor an affrighted remnant, a poor fag-end of the <hi>world,</hi> waſted and conſumed by ſword, plagues, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that they that have nothing, ſhould yet give to God: When men are waſted and conſum'd to nothing, yet that <hi>that nothing</hi> ſhould be able to <hi>adde</hi> and <hi>give</hi> to God, this is worth your obſervation.</p>
            <p>So long as we are any thing, we are ſtill attributing and giving to our ſelves; and when we are wholly revelled out into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and loſt, then we are contented to <hi>give all to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is much that we that are nothing, ſhould give to him that is al things; and it is <hi>very much</hi> that we ſhould give him glory; that which is moſt dear to him, and that he ſhould accept of it from a poor affrighted Remnant: Though (I ſay) the glory of God be <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>exceeding deare</hi> to him, and that of which he is moſt <hi>Jelous,</hi> yet it is not dear to him until we give it him; and then it's double glory; even then when it comes from a poor affrighted Remnant: When God can come and ſpeak out of the mouth of a poor creature, waſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:106962:142"/>to nothing that is his glory. It is not his glory that he hath it from Mighty Angels; No, he <hi>laies aſide that nature,</hi> and is pleaſed to accept of it from poor fleſh, poor man, poor waſted, conſumed man. I ſay, Our God hath his glory from waſted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed man.</p>
            <p>God hath glory in waſting and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fleſh in man: He takes away the glory from the creature into himſelf.</p>
            <p>Gods greateſt glory is to repair waſted man. When man is carried out of himſelf, into the loweſt eſtate that can be; when the glory of man is laid flat upon the Earth, then GOD is gathering it up into his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>And this is certain, til this poor <hi>remnant gives glory to God,</hi> God hath viſibly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtively no glory at all. It muſt be this poor man, this waſted man, this poor fleſh, this poor creature, walking through the <hi>fire,</hi> and paſſing through many tribulations that muſt ſet this Crown of glory upon the head of God; that muſt make God glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; a glorious bleſſed God.</p>
            <p>The root and foundation of the glory of God, is loſt and undone man.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:106962:143"/>—And gave glory to the God of heaven]</q>
            <p>Before (as I ſaid) they gave glory to themſelves; or if they gave glory to any God, it was to that <hi>God</hi> that is the God of this world.</p>
            <p>All that men contend for in the ſtrength or power of man, is to give glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Gods of this world, the Gods of the earth. Thers is indeed a ſeed of ſincerity in the Saints, that gives glory to the God of Heaven, but it is in a poor low, dark, way; Propheſying in <hi>ſack-cloth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe ſtand before the God of the Earth as the Olive tree on the left hand of God, offering Sacrifice to the God of Heaven, though it is as yet but in an Earthly manner: unto God it is, though in weakneſſe; or, unto the God of Heaven in an Earthly way.</p>
            <p>That which moſt men in this world doe, is to give glory to themſelves, or to <hi>the God of this world,</hi> the devill, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.20 <hi>And the reſt of the men which were not killed by theſe plagues, yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they ſhould not worſhip devils and Idols, of gold, ſilver and braſſe, and ſtone, and

            </p>
            <p>The greateſt care and induſtry of moſt men, is onely to maintaine an outward, earthly power; an outward government, an outward worldly Kingdom a State Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: which is nothing elſe but ſecretly to provide for their owne carnall peace, carnal eaſe, fleſhly and diabolical State and ſo they worſhip the divel, and give glory to the god of this World: Now when a <hi>man</hi> is <hi>waſted</hi> and <hi>conſumed,</hi> and <hi>affrighted,</hi> and brought to a <hi>Remnant,</hi> he is contented to give <hi>glory</hi> to God, to the true God, and to him in <hi>Heaven,</hi> in a heavenly way: and the <hi>matching</hi> of theſe two together, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding wonderfull and glorious thing; that the lower end of man cut down by the Ax of the Spirit to a ſtump, and left a poor remnant; That this retched creature, this poor Remnant, ſhould be able to give glory to the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Heaven:</hi> That is, ſhould ſo ſpeak, act and live, as to be alwaies gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving glory to <hi>the God</hi> of Heaven, or rather, that it ſhould ſpeak, act and live the glory of the God of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and enjoy continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all communion and fellowſhip with the God of Heaven; that it ſhould be able to ſet forth, adorne and beautify the God of

               <hi>Heaven,</hi> in a heavenly way; to hold forth God in his brightnes, excellency and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</p>
            <p>This is the work we are called unto, through <hi>death,</hi> through <hi>ſlaying,</hi> through <hi>Earth-quakes,</hi> through <hi>commotions,</hi> through temptations, to aſcribe and give glory to the God of <hi>Heaven;</hi> to give up our ſelves to the glory of the God of <hi>Heaven;</hi> to give up that little, that nothing that remaines of us, <hi>that Remnant</hi> to be to the glory, or to be the glory of the <hi>God</hi> of Heaven, or to ſuffer the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> to render himſelf glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious upon us; I ſay, This is wonderful.</p>
            <p>Why have we <hi>heads, bearts, hands</hi> &amp; <hi>tongues</hi> to be kill'd and ſlain, waſted and conſumed to nothing; but to be raiſed again? What is it for, but that the God of Heaven ſhould enjoy them? So long as we kept and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed them to our ſelves, we uſed them to the glory of the god of the Earth; but now having been waſted and conſumed to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and raiſed again, they are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſervice, for the uſe, and to the glory of the God of <hi>Heaven:</hi> And now in this condition, we are in <hi>Heaven;</hi> now we are in the Kingdome of God, in the preſence of GOD, in the Majeſty and

            </p>
            <p>It pleaſed God to devide theſe <hi>woes</hi> into three parts, a firſt, a ſecond, and a third.

            <p>As there is the <hi>day</hi> of man, the <hi>day</hi> of Chriſt, and the <hi>day</hi> of God; ſo their is the glory of <hi>Man,</hi> the glory of Chriſt, and the glory of God.

            <p>It is an happy ſtate the <hi>witneſſes</hi> are in when they are raiſed from the <hi>dead:</hi> yet it's not laſting, though their condition be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious yet it hath a <hi>woe</hi> ſtealing upon it; yea, though it be a very bleſſed ſtate; a <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> from a ſinfull Earth: yet it is ſuch a

            <p>The <hi>Third woe</hi> is a tolerable <hi>woe:</hi> though it hath its ſting, yet it comes quickly and goes quickly: It's ſuch a one as we are wel able to endure. And then cometh the ſeventh Angell Sounding, and hee ſaith aloud,</p>

            <p>The ſeven Trumpets are all but one Trumpet, <hi>The laſt Trump ſhall ſound.</hi> The Spirit of the <hi>LORD</hi> being able either to contract all into one, or to enlarge one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeven, when, and as he pleaſeth: He can give all to one, call it one, make it one; diſcover it and open it into one, or enlarge it into ſeven. Seven dayes make but one with him; Seven Angels, and ſeven Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, make but one Angel, and one Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet with him.</p>
            <p>Seven is a number of reſt and bleſſedneſs: and here is the <hi>ſeventh Angel,</hi> or the ange li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call nature in et's perfection; Chriſt the Head of Angels, or the Perfection of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>

            <p>The exellency or perfection of Angels is to trumpet out the laſt and greateſt glory of God: Yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Arch-angel,</hi> the <hi>head</hi> and <hi>chiefeſt Angel,</hi> takes pleaſure to ſound forth the glory of God, before the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the Higheſt and Laſt glory.</p>

            <p>After the ſounding of the Trumpet comes forth the <hi>voices;</hi> which is a more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and excellent note in muſick then the ſound of the Trumpet. No Organ or Inſtrument ſends forth ſo ſweet a note as the tongue of man.</p>

               <hi>What you ſpeak in a cornes ſhall be publiſhed on the houſe top.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Al the appearances of God, have been but as in a corner. Though the ſending out of the Apoſtles into the World, did typify that univerſal, free, abundant declaration of GOD, this Name of God in the World: Yet al that which hath been made known of God hitherto, hath been but a ſpeaking in a corner, in compariſon of that which is now breaking forth.</p>
            <p>God hath been ſpoken of in a corner, heer a little and there a little: But now there comes a great Voyce, that throwes downe <hi>State, Kings, Kingdomes</hi> and al the powers of the Earth; to make way for the glory of God.</p>
            <p>God wil whiſper it no longer, nor ſpeak with a faint Voyce, with a cold language; but wil ſpeak ſo, and come ſo, That every Eye ſhall ſee him; every Eare ſhall heare him; every Tongue ſhal ſpeak him, and every heart ſhal acknowledge and confeſſe him; This is the LORD. Now doth GOD REIGNE. Now is Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.</p>
            <p>This Voyce may be heard in Hel, and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:106962:149"/>ſpoken in wrath: but when ever it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken freely and aloud with joy, then it is in Heaven to the Saints: And this is the cloſe of the great Voyce <hi>The Kingdomes of this world are become the Kingdomes of our Lord and of his Chriſt</hi>]</p>
            <q>— The Kingdomes of this world are become &amp;c.</q>
            <p>God heretofore hath had the meaneſt of this World: A ſort of poor, low, mean People only have teſtified a little for God and Chriſt: heer a little, and there an handful: but doe you think it, or can it be thought, That God wil alwaies be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with this? Or doe you thinke the GREAT things of the World were made eternally for the Devil and wicked men? Or can it be imagined that God ſhould fil a World with men, and furniſh them with parts and abilities; Greatneſſe, Wiſdome, Riches, Majeſty, Authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that wicked men ſhould alwaies abuſe them, and devils alwaies have the command of them, and God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be excluded and ſhut out.</p>
            <pb n="275" facs="tcp:106962:149"/>
            <p>No, no ſuch matter: No, the Kingdomes of this World, al the <hi>Riches,</hi> al the <hi>Strength,</hi> al the <hi>Authority,</hi> al the <hi>Power,</hi> al the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, Juſtice, Judgement</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> of this World, both in reſpect of Civel and Eccleſiaſtical Government: <hi>Al the Kingdomes of this World, ſhall become the Kingdomes of our Lord and of his Chriſt:</hi> We dare in the power of the Lord ſpeak it: The <hi>Voyce</hi> wil be, No man hath to doe with any <hi>Power, Authority, Wiſdome, Riches</hi> or any thing in the World: No creature hath any power or priviledge to diſpoſe of any thing on the Earth: Al <hi>Power, Strength, Riches</hi> &amp;c. are taken from men; or if any thing be left, that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines is conſuming and blaſting, and ſhal waſt away, til al greatnes and excellency whatſoever reſolves it ſelfe into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of OUR Lord <hi>and of his Chriſt;</hi> The Kingdome of <hi>Our</hi> Lord they are become. OUR Lord now muſt Reign: Al things now are become his. They were <hi>Our</hi> Lords from the beginning, and of right al did belong to him: If he did intruſt them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings, Nobles, Great ones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it was but onely as they were his Servants; they were but intruſted and committed to them
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:106962:150"/>as <hi>Talents;</hi> they are but his Stewards; and <hi>woe</hi> be his Stewards, when he turnes them out of their Sewardſhip; they muſt be Stewards no longer; but muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Stewardſhip, of their <hi>Talents:</hi> And theſe Kingdomes of the World, muſt immediately become the Kingdomes of <hi>Our</hi> Lord, <hi>and of his Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wee have a Lord that is a Lord indeed, <hi>The great Lord of Heaven and Earth, The Lord af Lords, and King of Kings:</hi> others are but Images and Pictures of this <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R LORD,</hi> they are but his Subſtitutes; and now <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R</hi> Lord comes and throwes out al other Lords; He caſts theſe <hi>Stewards</hi> out of their places; and the Kingdomes of the World return again to Him, whoſe they are.</p>
            <p>They were of old thine, only they were let out to uſe for a while: The original right is in <hi>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R Lord;</hi> he hath it, and wil maintain it; and he himſelf wil Reigne. The Spirit of God hath propheſied of this in al Ages, and now he is performing it; The next Age, nay, at this time, this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is <hi>Our Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for Our LORD, now for the <hi>great GOD.</hi> Now for <hi>Our King: Now all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:106962:150"/>of the World, are become the Kingdomes of O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R Lord.</hi> OUR Lord wil take al, and leave nothing un-poſſeſſed.

            </p>
            <p>This LORD ſhall have all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the Earth; and he will put us in poſſeſſon of al that is good, excellent, rich, beautiful, all that is Kingly and Noble; all that excels; al the Kingdomes of the World.</p>
            <p>And out of the Lord, and from the Lord ſhal be nothing but deſolation and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: yea, deſolation and confuſion it ſelfe is our Lords priſon, into which our Lord wil caſt his enemies.

            </p>
            <p>It is Chriſt in the glory of the Father that is Our happineſſe and Our life. The Son in the glory and power of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: God exalting the Son into himſelfe.</p>

            <p>The Kingdomes of the World are the LORDS yet ſo the LORDS as that Chriſt is King epual with the Father.</p>
            <p>Chriſt laies down his Kingdome, that he might aſcend into the Kingdome of the Father. And we lay down our Kingdomes of the World and creatures, that we might live in the Kingdome of Chriſt; that ſo the Father, Chriſt and Wee might Reigne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

            <p>There are many Anointed, that pretend to be THE Anointed of God: And many there be that have ſome Anointing: But none ſhal Reign, but <hi>His Anointed:</hi> The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of God; the Anointed of God; Hee that is filled with the Spirit of God; Hee that is Anointed with the Oyle (the Oyle of GGD) He ſhal Reign for ever; no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: None but the ANOINTED of GOD.</p>
            <p>OUR God Anoints US, and We are the Anointed of GOD; the Chriſt of GOD;
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:106962:151"/>the holy one of God; all gathered up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Anointing, one Anointed, one God: and in this unity, all in one, we ſhal <hi>Reign</hi> with him for ever and ever: And ſo its ſaid, <hi>Revelations</hi> 5. <hi>He hath made us Kings and Prieſts to our God: and we ſhall reign on the earth:</hi> The World ſhal become ours.

            <p>Satan and wicked men have <hi>Reigned long,</hi> but they ſhall <hi>Reign</hi> no longer. So <hi>long</hi> as Satan can <hi>Reign</hi> over us, we are ſubject to

We are the Lords, the Holy ones of God; and none but the <hi>HOLY ONE</hi> of God <hi>Reignes</hi> over us.</p>
            <q>—Wee give thee thanks O LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, which ART, and WAST, and art to GOME; becauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy GREAT Power and hast Reigned.</q>
            <p>The LORD, the LORD Reigns, he hath taken to him his Kingdome; that is it for which <hi>wee give Thanks;</hi> His King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and <hi>Our Thanks-giving.</hi> And wee thank not man, but God: Thanks are due to none but GOD.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the Lord Reigns, and wee ſhall Reign, Therefore <hi>we give thanks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reign of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is an Eternall
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:106962:152"/>Reign; <hi>For ever.</hi> But the Reign of GOD is for <hi>ever</hi> and <hi>ever;</hi> two Eternals.</p>
            <p>The Reign of Chriſt is an Everlaſting Reign, yet he gives it up into the hands of the Father; and <hi>God</hi> becomes <hi>all in all,</hi> and Reignes for <hi>ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are two Eternities in this Reign, the Lords and his <hi>Chriſts.</hi> The <hi>LORD</hi> delights to double his excellencies; to multiply Eternities: and there is no minute wherein it can be ſaid our <hi>LORD</hi> doth not Reign, no ſeaſon or time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it can bee ſaid our LORD doth not Reign.</p>
            <p>Whileſt the LORD doth give forth favour and grace by man, and man gives thanks to man, its not the Eternal Reign of <hi>God</hi> and Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Reign of God is without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; it's for <hi>ever:</hi> It is in all things, and at all times: It is in height and depth, in day and night, in ſummer and winter: It's Eternal, for <hi>ever</hi> and <hi>ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:106962:153"/>—Which art, and waſt, and art to come]</q>
            <p>Here are three Eternals.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The Eternal that was before the world. This Kingdome was before all times, and ſhall bee after all times, when <hi>times ſhall be no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>—Which ART]</q>
            <p>It is preſent, it's no longer abſent: yet it is to come, but not ſo to come as that we want it; but it is ſo to come, that we ſhal enjoy it everlaſtingly: It takes in all times, paſt, preſent, and to come. It is that Circle of Eternity that comprehends al, beginning and ending.</p>
            <q>—And HE ſhall Reign for ever, and ever]</q>
            <p>Now there is a bouble uſe made of this by the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>Thanks be to God, by them that dwell in Heaven: Down with al your glory,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:106962:153"/>lay down al your excellency; that is, the excellency of al that are heavenly, to give thanks to God.</p>
            <p>In the 16. <hi>verſe</hi> its ſaid, <hi>They fell upon their faces and worſhipped God:</hi> They lie down in the duſt, are baſe and worth-leſs in their own eyes, that they may give glory to GOD.</p>
            <p>Now they ſay, nothing is excellent, righteous or good but God. Worſhip <hi>God,</hi> fear none, acknowledge none but God: ſpeak nothing, love nothing, be nothing, do nothing but God.</p>
            <q>—Wee give THEE thanks]</q>
            <p>Here is thanks, here's praiſes, here's rejoycing; LORD GOD ALMIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY, We bleſſe <hi>THEE,</hi> wee rejoyce in <hi>THEE,</hi> wee are exceeding glad of <hi>THEE;</hi> we never expected good from men, if wee did, they fail'd us: There is nothing but oppreſſion in man: But in <hi>THEE</hi> is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
            <p>Certainly God wil Reign in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, in juſtice and truth. Men are in
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:106962:154"/>tumults, wars, plots, miſchiefs: But GOD Reignes in truth and righteouſneſſe. And the GREAT Kingdome of the LORD is our joy; Therefore—<hi>Wee give THEE thanks</hi> O LORD GOD ALMIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY.</p>
            <q>—The Nations were angry, and thy wrath is come]</q>
            <p>The World, and the powers of the World are <hi>angry;</hi> they fret, they vex, they cry-out this is Blaſphemy. And we expect nothing but wrath from the world, and it's proper for them that they ſhould be wrath; our joy is their wrath: See how an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gry man is, freting, and vexing at Gods pulling down the Kingdoms of the Earth. This is the reaſon of that bitterneſſe and malice, that fury and madneſſe, that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men: What makes them ſo unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, killing and deſtroying one another: but becauſe God is over-turning the glory of the world? What makes men ſo full of wrath, but becauſe <hi>Thy wrath O LORD is come?</hi>
            </p>
            <q>

            <p>Nothing is <hi>life</hi> and <hi>light</hi> but the LORD; nothing <hi>lives</hi> but the LORD, and thoſe that live in the Spirit of the Lord: as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they are dead, and ſhal be <hi>judged as the dead:</hi> But thoſe who live in the Spirit of <hi>life</hi> which is in God, they triumph over death, and that deſtruction that comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Kingdomes of the world: They with joy can ſpeak on this manner,</p>
            <p>Their Wrath, is our Love; their Griefe, is our Comfort; their Anger is our Peace; their Trouble is our Reward; their Ruine is our Life.</p>
            <p>This is the application the Spirit of the Lord makes to the Nations, which none can with ſtand.</p>
